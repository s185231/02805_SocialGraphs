==== 2018 ====

In 2018, Davids ran for the United States House of Representatives in Kansas's 3rd congressional district. In the August Democratic primary election, she defeated Brent Welder, who had been endorsed by Bernie Sanders, 37% to 34%.During a July 2018 episode of the Millennial Politics Podcast, host Jordan Valerie Allen asked Davids whether she supported abolishing ICE, the agency that enforces immigration laws and falls within the oversight of the Department of Homeland Security, to which Davids responded, "you asked me about defunding, which I think is probably essentially the same thing. But yeah." Despite denials by Davids through campaign statements and a television advertisement, the Associated Press fact checker ruled that she did in fact lend her support to ending the agency.Kansas City NPR member station KCUR fact-checked the claims that incumbent Representative Kevin Yoder and Davids made in separate interviews on its station, and gave Yoder an "F". Yoder said that immigrants were making false asylum claims and would increase crime. Davids said that she supported single-payer health care, but it could not be enacted with Republicans in the White House. Meanwhile, she supports short-term goals like allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and getting generics to market faster. KCUR said that Davids's claim that teachers are not paid enough, and can no longer take tax deductions for buying their own school supplies, was "partly true and partly false" since the tax deduction had been reinstated.Davids defeated Yoder in the November 8 general election. Upon her swearing-in on January 3, 2019, she became the first Democrat to represent Kansas in the House since Dennis Moore left office in 2011. She is also only the second Democrat to represent what is now the 3rd since 1963.

==== 2022 ====

In 2022, Davids ran for reelection in the newly drawn 3rd district. Redistricting made the 3rd somewhat more Republican; it  lost most of Kansas City while picking up some exurban territory to the west.
