==== 2022 ====

In August 2021, Frost announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Florida's 10th congressional district. During the primary campaign, he released a television ad in Spanglish, telling The Hill, "Latinos are in a place where their first language is Spanish but they speak English as well, and quite frankly that's me ... We speak Spanglish in the house, and I know that's the same for a lot of Latino families in the district."Frost beat state Senator Randolph Bracy and former U.S. Representatives Alan Grayson and Corrine Brown, among others, in the August 23, 2022, primary. Due to the district's Democratic tilt, Frost was expected to win the general election in November 2022, which he did, defeating Republican Calvin Wimbish by a 19% margin, which was smaller than the 32% margin by which Biden won the district in 2020. Frost is the youngest member of Congress and the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress. He was endorsed by numerous national and local political figures, including Jesse Jackson, former NAACP President Ben Jealous, civil rights activist Dolores Huerta, and U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

=== Iran ===
Frost believes that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) "certainly fell short in ways, but it blocked Iran’s ability to build a nuclear weapon, which was an important success." In 2022 he supported restoration of the JACPOA but stressed "we must make it longer, stronger, and broader to cover not just the issue of nuclear weapons, but also the full range of destabilizing and threatening actions Iran engages in, like Iran’s ballistic missile program and the country’s support for terrorist proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas."


=== Israel ===
Frost supports a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and has indicated his intent to travel to Israel to promote "US leadership in bringing peace to a region that so desperately needs and deserves it." He has called himself pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian. He supports unconditional U.S. military aid to Israel. He has criticized the Palestinian Authority's martyr's fund that compensates the families of dead and wounded militants, likening it to a recruitment tactic of Hamas for the purpose of committing politically motivated violence against Israel. Frost vehemently opposes the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, accuses it of harboring leadership from terrorist organizations, and suggests that businesses that participate in BDS should in turn be divested.Frost had formerly participated in pro-Palestine activism, signing pledges with the Florida Palestine Network (FPN) and the Palestinian Feminist Pledge, calling for support of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, ending military aid to Israel, and rejecting the conflation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism. In early August 2022, the Jewish news website Jewish Insider published a candidate questionnaire from Frost's congressional campaign that showed a shift in Frost's foreign policy positions on Israel and Palestine. Jewish Insider characterized his responses as a reversal that distanced himself from his past while declaring an aggressive stance against the BDS movement, calling for unconditional military aid to Israel, and stating his opposition to anti-Zionism. His campaign later released a position paper that formalized these positions.Frost voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


=== Crypto regulation ===
During his campaign, Frost announced a "crypto-advisory council" that would advise him during his campaign. He received $8,700 in contributions from Sam Bankman-Fried and his brother and nearly $1 million in help from the Super-PAC Protect Our Future, almost all of it after announcing the council.

He said his credit rating was bad because he "ran up a lot of debt running for Congress for a year and a half".Frost was among a handful of Democrats who received about $1 million in support from former billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's Protect Our Future PAC, as well as the maximum individual donation of $2,900. In December 2022, the U.S. government indicted Bankman-Fried after alleging that he gave investor money to progressive political candidates, among other fraudulent crimes.
