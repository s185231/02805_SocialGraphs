Steven Brett Guthrie (born February 18, 1964) is an American businessman and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Kentucky's 2nd congressional district since 2009. The district is in central Kentucky and includes Fort Knox, Owensboro, Bowling Green, and Danville. Guthrie previously served as a Republican member of the Kentucky Senate.


== Early life, education, and career ==
Guthrie was born in Florence, Alabama, the son of Carolyn P. (née Holt) and Lowell M. Guthrie. He earned his Bachelor of Science in mathematical economics at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1987 and his Master's of Public and Private Management at Yale School of Management in 1997.
Guthrie is a former vice president of Trace Die Cast, Inc., an automotive parts supplier based in Bowling Green. He previously served as a field artillery officer in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
2008
In the 2008 congressional general election, Guthrie defeated Democratic nominee State Senator David Boswell for the right to succeed the retiring U.S. Representative Ron Lewis. Lewis announced his retirement on the last day for candidates to file for the seat in 2008, in hopes of steering the Republican nomination to his chief of staff, Daniel London. Guthrie defeated London for the nomination.

This set up the closest race in the 2nd in 14 years. Democrats had a large advantage in registration, but voters had been very conservative on social issues. This was a major reason Lewis had been able to hold the district with little trouble since winning it in a 1994 special election. Guthrie prevailed by 15,500 votes, mostly on the strength of rural voters. He may have been boosted by voters being more motivated to come to the polls due to the presidential and Senate election held at the same time. Republican presidential nominee John McCain carried the district with 60% of the vote and won all but one county entirely within the district. Incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell also carried the 2nd district easily.

2010
The 2nd reverted to form in 2010, and Guthrie defeated Democratic nominee Ed Marksberry by a large margin.

2012
Guthrie won reelection in 2012 with over 64% of the vote.

2018
Guthrie filed for reelection on November 27, 2017. Two Democratic challengers filed against Guthrie: Grant Short and Brian Pedigo, both of whom ultimately lost to Democratic candidate Hank Linderman in the primary.
