Hakeem Sekou Jeffries ( hah-KEEM; born August 4, 1970) is an American politician and attorney who has served as House Minority Leader and Leader of the House Democratic Caucus since 2023. He has been the U.S. representative for New York's 8th congressional district since 2013 and was a member of the New York State Assembly from 2007 to 2012.
Jeffries was born and raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York. He attended law school at New York University, graduating with honors and becoming a successful corporate lawyer before running for elective office. Both his state assembly district and congressional district are anchored in Brooklyn. 
In Congress, Jeffries chaired the House Democratic Caucus from 2019 to 2023. The members of the caucus unanimously elected him to succeed Nancy Pelosi as leader in November 2022. This made him the first African American to lead a party in either chamber of the United States Congress.


== Early life and career ==
Jeffries was born in New York City, at Brooklyn Hospital Center to Laneda Jeffries, a social worker, and Marland Jeffries, a state substance-abuse counselor. He has one brother, Hasan. He grew up in Crown Heights, Brooklyn and is a lifelong member of the Cornerstone Baptist Church.Jeffries graduated from Midwood High School in 1988. He then studied political science at Binghamton University, graduating in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors. During his time at Binghamton he became a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.Jeffries continued his education at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy, earning a Master of Public Policy degree in 1994. He then attended New York University School of Law, where he was a member of the New York University Law Review. He graduated magna cum laude in 1997 with a Juris Doctor degree and delivered the student address at Convocation.After graduating from law school, Jeffries spent one year as a law clerk for Judge Harold Baer Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.From 1998 to 2004, he was in private practice at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. In 2004, he became an corporate litigator for television companies Viacom and CBS, where among other matters he worked on the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. During Jeffries's time at Paul, Weiss, he also served as director of intergovernmental affairs for the New York State Chapter of the National Association of Minority Contractors (construction contractors) and as the president of Black Attorneys for Progress.


== New York State Assembly ==
Jeffries was elected and reelected, serving in the New York State Assembly for a Brooklyn district from 2007 to 2012. During this time, he introduced over 70 bills. In response to a series of toy recalls, he introduced bill A02589, which would penalize retailers and wholesalers that knowingly sell hazardous or dangerous toys that have been recalled.
In 2007, while still in his first term in the State Assembly, Jeffries endorsed and supported Barack Obama, and was among Obama's earliest supporters in Hillary Clinton's home state. In one interview, he said, "When I first ran for office, some people suggested that someone with the name 'Hakeem Jeffries' could never get elected, and when I saw someone with the name 'Barack Obama' get elected to the U.S. Senate, it certainly inspired me."While in the Assembly, Jeffries distinguished himself as a leader on seeking bipartisan criminal justice reform. In 2010, Governor David Paterson signed the Stop-and-Frisk database bill that banned police from compiling names and addresses of those stopped but not arrested during street searches.Jeffries wrote and sponsored that law. He also sponsored and passed House Bill A.9834-A (now law), the inmate-base gerrymandering law that counts prison populations of upstate districts as part of the public population, becoming the second state to end this practice.

=== Early years in Congress (2013–2018) ===
On April 11, 2013, Jeffries introduced the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Preservation Act (H.R. 1501; 113th Congress). The bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of designating the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn as a unit of the National Park System (NPS). Jeffries said, "as one of America's largest revolutionary war burial sites and in tribute to the patriots that lost their lives fighting for our nation's independence, this monument deserves to be considered as a unit of the National Park Service." On April 28, 2014, the Prison Ship Martyrs's Monument Preservation Act was passed by the House.On July 15, 2014, Jeffries, who in private practice addressed intellectual property issues, introduced the To establish the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (H.R. 5108; 113th Congress), which would establish the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to be available to accredited law schools for the ten-year period after enactment of the Act.In 2015, Jeffries led the effort to pass The Slain Officer Family Support Act, which extended the tax deadline for people making donations to organizations supporting the families of deceased NYPD Detectives Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. The families of the officers, who had been killed in their patrol car on December 20, 2014, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Jeffries's district, had been the recipients of charitable fundraising. Before the law's enactment, people would have had to make those contributions by December 31, 2014, to qualify for a tax deduction in connection with taxes filed in 2015. With the change, contributions made until April 15, 2015, were deductible. President Obama signed the bill into law on April 1, 2015.In 2015, prominent African-American pastors called for Jeffries to step into the 2017 Democratic primary for mayor against de Blasio. Jeffries said he had "no interest" and wished to remain a member of Congress.On May 22, 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bipartisan First Step Act by a 358–36 vote with Jeffries as a key sponsor. President Trump signed the bill into law on December 21, 2018. It eased mandatory minimum federal sentences, expanded early releases, and ended some draconian practices, such as the shackling of women inmates giving birth.Jeffries also played a key role in the House passage of the bipartisan Music Modernization Act, which became law in 2018.Among the practices Jeffries continued from his time in the Assembly in Congress is Summer at the Subway, rebranded as "Congress on Your Corner", offering outdoor evening office hours from June through August near subway stations that allow him to connect and hear constituents' concerns firsthand.


==== Committee assignments ====
As a freshman, Jeffries served on the influential Budget Committee. Later, he served on the Judiciary Committee. During the 114th Congress, Jeffries also served on the House Education and Workforce Committee. He has been a long-standing member of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus.


=== Leadership (2018–2022) ===


==== Democratic Caucus Chair ====
On November 28, 2018, Jeffries defeated California Congresswoman Barbara Lee to become chair of the House Democratic Caucus. His term began when the new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019. In this role, he was the fifth-ranking member of the Democratic leadership.


==== First impeachment of President Donald Trump ====
On January 15, 2020, Jeffries was selected as one of seven House managers presenting the impeachment case against Trump during his trial before the United States Senate. On January 22, 2020, a protester in the Senate gallery interrupted Jeffries by yelling comments at the senators seated a floor below. Jeffries quickly responded with a scripture verse, Psalm 37:28, "For the Lord loves justice and will not abandon his faithful ones", before continuing with his testimony.During the impeachment hearings, in response to Trump's counsel's rhetorical question “Why are we here?” to the Senate, Jeffries delivered a soliloquy that concluded by quoting Biggie Smalls: "and if you don't know, now you know". Billboard magazine called it a "noteworthy mic-drop moment".


=== House Democratic Leader (2022–) ===
With outgoing Speaker Pelosi's endorsement, Jeffries was elected unopposed as House Democratic Leader for the 118th Congress in November 2022, becoming the first African American to lead a party caucus in either chamber of Congress. Nominated for Speaker of the House by the caucus in the subsequent election, he received 212 votes, all from Democrats, on nearly every ballot. (David Trone missed the 12th round of voting for a surgery but returned for the 13th round.)
When Kevin McCarthy was elected Speaker, Jeffries handed him the gavel after a 15-minute speech. The speech was dubbed the "ABCs of Democracy". The video of Jeffries's alphabet speech has been viewed over 2.4 million times on social media alone.House Democrats unanimously nominated him again in the October 2023 election after the successful motion to vacate McCarthy's speakership.

== Political positions ==
He is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and, before becoming caucus leader, was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Jeffries is noted for his ability to work with Democrats across the caucus and Republicans on shared goals. Considered a centrist, he has said he is willing to work with Republicans "whenever possible, but we will also push back against extremism whenever necessary." He also maintains good working relationships with more progressive Democrats.In an interview with NY1, Republican former U.S. Representative Bob Goodlatte said of Jeffries: "One of the best skills a legislator can have is to be willing to communicate with anybody in a constructive way about how to get things done. And that's exactly the approach that he's taken", calling Jeffries "open to compromise".Since taking federal office, Jeffries has been called "a rising star". He has been appointed to the House Judiciary Committee Task Force on Over Criminalization, and was also appointed the whip of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). He plays in the infield on the Congressional Baseball Team.


=== Congressional Black Caucus ===
Before becoming House Democratic Leader, Jeffries served as the Congressional Black Caucus whip, having been elected to the position in November 2014. In that role, he was actively involved in maintaining the CBC's historic role as "the conscience of the Congress", addressing special orders on the House floor, including regarding voting rights (after the Supreme Court decision on the 1965 Voting Rights Act), and in December 2014 leading CBC members in a "hands up, don't shoot" protest of killings of African-Americans by police.After the shootings in Charleston in June 2015 by a white supremacist inspired by the Confederate flag, Jeffries led the effort to have the flag removed for sale or display on National Park Service land, an amendment the Republican House leadership eventually killed after its initial support and inclusion on voice vote. During debate on the House floor, Jeffries stood next to the Confederate battle flag, said he "got chills", and lamented that the "Ghosts of the Confederacy have invaded the GOP".


=== Criminal justice reform ===
Jeffries called for a Department of Justice investigation into the circumstances of Eric Garner's death. On a visit to the Staten Island site where Garner was killed, recorded by a CNN news crew in December 2014, Jeffries encountered Gwen Carr, Garner's mother. In April 2015, he stood with Carr to announce the introduction of the Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act of 2015, which would make chokeholds illegal under federal law.


=== Gun laws ===
Jeffries supports increased background checks for potential gun owners and a ban on assault weapons. After a mass shooting in Nashville, Tennessee left six dead, he called on Congress to bring the Bipartisan Background Checks Act and assault weapons ban to the House floor. "Our schools have become killing fields and our children slaughtered by weapons of war. It is time for Congress to put kids over guns", Jeffries wrote to Speaker McCarthy.In the 117th Congress, Jeffries voted in favor of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first gun safety bill passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law in nearly 30 years. The Act established provisions to hire new agents to crack down and target the so-called "Iron Pipeline", the illegal flow of guns sold in the south, transported up the East Coast, and found at crime scenes in cities from Baltimore to New York City.


=== Abortion rights ===
Jeffries slammed the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, calling it "an assault on freedom, the Constitution and the values shared by a majority of Americans". In the 118th Congress, he joined House Democratic lawmakers to reintroduce the Women's Health Protection Act, which would legally protect providing and accessing abortion care nationwide for patients and abortion providers.


=== LGBTQ rights ===
Jeffries supports banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, he voted in favor of the Equality Act and urged Congress members to do the same.


=== Cannabis ===
Jeffries reintroduced bipartisan legislation, the Preparing Regulators Effectively for a Post-Prohibition Adult Use Regulated Environment (PREPARE) Act, to create a transparent process for the federal government to establish effective regulations to be enacted upon the termination of the prohibition of cannabis. He also co-sponsored the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which would end the federal prohibition and criminalization of cannabis by removing it from the Controlled Substances Act and facilitate the expungement of low-level federal cannabis convictions while incentivizing state and local governments to do the same.In the past, Jeffries called on the New York City Police Commissioner to reform its cannabis arrest policy after reports showed that low-level cannabis arrests, which increased dramatically under Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration's application of stop-and-frisk, were still rising in New York City under Bloomberg's successor, Bill de Blasio.


=== Trump impeachment ===
Jeffries voted to impeach President Donald Trump during both his first and second impeachments in the House. He repeatedly called Trump's presidency "illegitimate" due to the Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election.


=== Foreign affairs ===


==== Russia's invasion of Ukraine ====
A member of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus, Jeffries has spoken out against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He defended the Biden administration's assistance to Ukraine throughout the crisis and voted to send relief.


==== Syria ====
In 2023, Jeffries voted against H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.


==== Israel ====
Jeffries visited Israel for his first trip abroad as House Democratic Leader. In Israel, he led a delegation of House Democrats (Gregory Meeks, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Yvette Clarke, Stacey Plaskett, Nanette Barragan, Josh Gottheimer, Steven Horsford, Lizzie Fletcher, Joe Neguse, Dean Phillips, and Sara Jacobs) and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Jeffries firmly supports Israel's right to exist as a Jewish democracy. He has been called "one of the most pro-Israel Democrats in the House". Jeffries also believes Israel has the right to defend itself from terrorism.Pro-Israel groups cheered Jeffries's ascent to House Democratic Leader due to his staunch support for Israel. He has traveled to Israel five times since being elected to Congress.In 2020, Jeffries told a conference of the US's largest and most powerful pro-Israel lobby group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), "back home in New York City we consider Jerusalem to be the sixth borough".Upon the onset of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Jefferies reiterated his support for Israel, saying, "Our commitment to Israel's security is ironclad."


== Elections ==


=== New York State Assembly ===
In 2000, while a lawyer at Paul Weiss, Jeffries challenged incumbent Assemblyman Roger Green in the Democratic primary. He criticized Green for inattentiveness to his constituents' needs and preoccupation with pursuing higher office after the incumbent had run for New York City Public Advocate in 1997 and had spoken of his plans to run for Congress upon the retirement of Edolphus Towns. Jeffries lost the primary, 59% to 41%, but remained on the Independence Party line in the general election, receiving 7% of the vote to Green's 90%.During post-census redistricting, Jeffries's home was drawn one block outside of Green's Assembly district as Prospect Heights was removed from the district. Jeffries was still legally permitted to run in the district for the 2002 cycle, as state law requires only that a candidate live in the same county as a district they seek in the first election after a redistricting, but this complicated his path and left Jeffries unable to challenge Green in the 2004 Democratic primary. Green claimed he did not know where Jeffries lived. Jeffries lost the 2002 primary, 52% to 38%. Interviewed later about the redistricting, Jeffries said, "Brooklyn politics can be pretty rough, but that move was gangsta."The 2002 redistricting left Jeffries unable to challenge Green in the 2004 Democratic primary, which took place after Sheldon Silver and Democratic leadership forced Green to resign after he pleaded guilty to billing the state for false travel expenses. Green was renominated unopposed.In 2006, Green retired from the Assembly to run for the U.S. House from New York's 10th congressional district against incumbent U.S. Representative Ed Towns. Jeffries ran for the 57th district again and won the Democratic primary, defeating Bill Batson and Freddie Hamilton with 64% of the vote. In the general election, he handily defeated Republican nominee Henry Weinstein.Jeffries was reelected in 2008, defeating Republican nominee Charles Brickhouse with 98% of the vote. In 2010 he was reelected to a third term, easily defeating Republican nominee Frank Voyticky.


=== U.S. House ===


==== 2012 election ====

In January 2012, Jeffries announced that he would give up his Assembly seat to run for the U.S. House from New York's 8th congressional district. The district, which includes the Brooklyn communities of Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Bed-Stuy, Brownsville, East New York, Canarsie, Mill Basin and Coney Island along with South Ozone Park and Howard Beach in Queens, had previously been the 10th, represented by 30-year incumbent Democrat Edolphus Towns.
Jeffries expected to give Towns a strong challenge in the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district. But with Jeffries assembling "a broad coalition of support", Towns announced his retirement on April 16, leaving Jeffries to face city councilman Charles Barron in the Democratic primary.Jeffries was supported by a broad coalition of local leaders from across the district. On June 11, 2012, former Mayor Ed Koch, Congressman Jerrold Nadler, Councilman David Greenfield, Assemblyman Dov Hikind and other elected officials and community leaders held a joint event to support Jeffries's campaign.While President Barack Obama did not openly support candidates in Democratic primaries, he and President Bill Clinton together took a photograph with Jeffries weeks before his 2012 Congressional primary against Charles Barron, which was effectively used in campaign literature.Jeffries defeated Barron in the June 26 primary election, 72% to 28%. A New York Daily News editorial noted that Barron had been "repudiated" in all parts of the district, including among neighbors on Barron's own block in East New York, which he lost.
In the general election, Jeffries defeated Republican nominee Alan Bellone and Green Party nominee Colin Beavan with 71% of the vote.On January 3, 2013, he was sworn in to the 113th Congress. He has since been reelected six successive times.
