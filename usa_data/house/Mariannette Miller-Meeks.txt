=== Elections ===


==== 2008, 2010, 2014 ====

Miller-Meeks was the Republican nominee for Iowa's 2nd congressional district in 2008, 2010 and 2014, losing to Dave Loebsack in all three races.


==== 2014 ====

In her 2014 campaign, Miller-Meeks opposed the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). She also stated her opposition to legalized abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or harm to the mother. She opposed same-sex marriage. She criticized EPA regulation of waterways and coal plants, saying it creates uncertainty for farmers.


==== 2020 ====

Miller-Meeks ran to represent Iowa's 2nd congressional district again in 2020, following Loebsack's retirement. She won the June 2 Republican primary election, defeating former Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, she said she "practices social distancing, wears a mask in public and sanitizes her hands" but does not support face mask mandates.She faced the Democratic nominee, former State Senator Rita Hart, in the November general election. After Loebsack announced his retirement, journalists and election forecasters labeled the 2nd congressional district a swing district. Miller-Meeks defeated Hart in the general election by six votes, making this the closest election in 2020 and flipping Iowa's 2nd Congressional District from Democratic to Republican control in one of the closest races in 100 years; the state certified the victory. Hart contested the certified result through a petition with the Committee on House Administration under the 1969 Federal Contested Elections Act, which sets forth procedures for contesting state election results in the House under the Constitution. Hart did not contest the election in Iowa's courts. In her petition, Hart contended, without evidence, that 22 legally cast votes were not counted. Had they been counted, per her petition, she would have won the race by nine votes.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi provisionally seated Miller-Meeks on January 3, 2021, pending adjudication of Hart's petition. The Committee on House Administration reviewed Hart's petition, and Pelosi claimed the House had the authority to expel Miller-Meeks, but on March 31, Hart withdrew her challenge.Miller-Meeks and Michelle Fischbach are the only Republican members of Congress to flip Democratic House districts that were not held by Republicans in the 115th Congress before 2018.


==== 2022 ====

Miller-Meeks ran for reelection, this time in Iowa's 1st congressional district, for the 2022 elections. During redistricting, her home in Ottumwa was drawn into the neighboring 3rd district, but almost all of her former territory was drawn into the 1st, effectively trading district numbers with fellow Republican freshman Ashley Hinson. While members of the House are only required to live in the state they represent, Miller-Meeks moved to Le Claire, near Davenport. Miller-Meeks defeated Democratic nominee Christina Bohannan in the November 2022 general election.
