=== Tenure ===


==== Hurricane Katrina ====
In September 2005, Foxx was one of 11 members of Congress to vote against the $51 billion aid package to victims of Hurricane Katrina.


==== Heroes Earned Retirement Opportunities (HERO) Act ====
The first bill Foxx sponsored that was signed into law was the HERO Act, signed by President George W. Bush on Memorial Day 2006. It allows U.S. troops to increase their retirement savings by investing a portion of their combat pay into Individual Retirement Accounts.


==== Electronic Pay Stub Act ====
The second bill Foxx sponsored that was signed into law is the Electronic Pay Stub Act, which gives federal employees the choice of receiving their pay stubs electronically. This legislation was projected to save taxpayers millions of dollars. Studies have shown that it costs 10 times more to purchase and distribute paper stubs than it does to distribute electronic stubs. This bill was signed into law in October 2008.


==== Troubled Asset Relief Program ====
Shortly after Congress approved the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Foxx identified a provision in the law that allowed her to force consideration of a measure to deny the second, $350 billion, tranche of the TARP bailout. On November 19, 2008, she introduced H.J.Res. 101, which met all the parliamentary requirements for consideration once the president requested the second tranche.In the next (111th) Congress, Foxx reintroduced the measure as H.J.Res. 3, and shortly before leaving office, Bush requested the second tranche, thereby activating the trigger allowing her to commandeer the House floor, although she was not a member of the majority party. Her measure passed the House 270–155; the act was never addressed in the Senate.In a 2007 interview, Foxx said, "We have the best economy we have had in 50 years."


==== Opposition to LGBT rights ====
In April 2009, Foxx expressed opposition to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, claiming that Matthew Shepard's murder was not a hate crime. While debating the act in the House, she called the murder a "very unfortunate incident" but claimed "we know that that young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery. It wasn't because he was gay." She ultimately called that allegation "a hoax that continues to be used as an excuse for passing hate crimes bills." Some media outlets, including the New York Times, Washington Post, and Huffington Post, criticized her statements, as did Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Democratic sources claimed that Matthew Shepard's mother was present during Foxx's statements.Foxx later retracted her comments, suggesting her use of the word "hoax" was in bad taste. She suggested that Shepard's murder was a tragedy and that his killers had received appropriate justice.In 2010, Foxx voted against the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act.In 2015, Foxx condemned the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.In 2019, Foxx strongly opposed the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and urged Congress members to vote against it.


==== Health care debate ====
When commenting on the House version of the reform bill that funds counseling for end-of-life issues, Foxx said, "Republicans have a better solution that won't put the government in charge of people's health care" and "[The plan] is pro-life because it will not put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government." She later said, "we have more to fear from the potential of the Affordable Health Care for America Act passing than we do from any terrorist right now in any country."


==== Turkish American Caucus ====
Foxx has been a member of the Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans since 2005. Her former son-in-law, Mustafa Özdemir, is a Turkish businessman.

==== House security ====

Foxx ran through the magnetometer, setting it off, and ignored officers attempting to prevent her entering the House floor.


==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
Foxx, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.


==== Behavior with the news media ====
Foxx has been known for frequently scolding reporters and staff for being on or near members-only elevators in Capitol buildings. In October 2023 while amongst Republicans gathered for a press conference for then-House speaker nominee Mike Johnson, she was scrutinized for screaming at a reporter to "go away" and "shut up" when he was asked to speak about his efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.

Foxx opposes legal access to abortion. She voted for a bill to repeal a rule requiring state and local governments to distribute federal funds to qualified health centers, even if they perform abortions.
