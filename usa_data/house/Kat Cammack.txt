On the House floor, she said the January 6 attacks "furthermore resolved" her objection to the certification process and that, as representatives of the people, members of Congress must stand for a free and fair election.

=== Immigration and border security ===
Cammack has supported the construction of a border wall along the Mexico–United States border.On July 22, 2021, Cammack claimed on the House floor that NGOs transport undocumented migrants around the country at U.S. government expense.
And you ask, how are they getting to our hometowns? On our dime.
  The NGOs have government contracts. They buy plane tickets and bus 
tickets, and then they submit reimbursement from FEMA on our dime in 
our hometowns unchecked, unvetted, and coming to a town near you. Every 
town in America is a border town.
  And as they are on these planes, do they have to show ID? No. No, 
they do not, because TSA has special guidance that these people are not 

subject to the same requirements that every other American is when they board an airplane.
During the 2022 United States infant formula shortage, Cammack criticized the Biden administration for sending baby formula to detention facilities on the U.S.–Mexico border. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that under the Flores Settlement Agreement, the U.S. is required to provide adequate and age-appropriate food, "hence formula for kids under the age of 1." During an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, Cammack showed pictures of baby formula she said she had received from a CBP agent. Tommy Christopher wrote that some of the images used in Cammack's interview with Hannity were not of baby formula but of powdered milk for children older than one. Hannity later acknowledged on Twitter that two of the pictures he aired during Cammack's appearance were milk products for children over one.

She voted against the act and numerous other protections for LGBTQ Americans during her time in Congress. On July 19, 2022, Cammack and 46 other Republican representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.
