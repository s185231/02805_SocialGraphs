In 2016, Biggs ran for Congress from the 5th District to replace retiring Representative Matt Salmon. He led the field in the four-way Republican primary, finishing nine votes ahead of his nearest opponent, businesswoman Christine Jones. A recanvass boosted Biggs's margin to 16 votes, and an automatic recount confirmed him as the nominee by 27 votes. His primary victory virtually assured him of being the next representative from the district; the 5th and its predecessors have been in Republican hands for all but one term since 1953.

Pennsylvania, an unsuccessful lawsuit that asked the Supreme Court to overturn election results from Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, thereby denying Joe Biden from taking office as president.Biggs also spoke at rallies promoting the "Stop the Steal" election conspiracy movement, and has claimed antifa was behind the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol. He denied that he was involved in planning the event and the riots as alleged by Rolling Stone and a video posted by Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander. In a deposition to the January 6 committee of the House of Representatives, Alexander testified that he spoke in person with Biggs before the events.On October 7, 2021, Biggs again falsely claimed that "we don't know who won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election".


==== 2021 attack on the United States Capitol ====
During the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Biggs and all other House members were ushered to a secure location when the House chamber was cleared. A video of Biggs later surfaced in which he refused to wear a face mask during the COVID-19 pandemic, a violation of House rules.

They wrote that Biggs is "at least partially to blame" for the Capitol storming. They also condemned his refusal to wear a mask in the secure location. According to William and Daniel Biggs, this "was a passive-aggressive tantrum and the ultimate disrespect for all present".Biggs was one of 12 House Republicans to vote against H.R 1085 to award three Congressional Gold Medals to the U.S. Capitol Police who protected the Capitol on January 6. In June 2021, he and 20 other House Republicans voted against a similar resolution.The House committee investigating the January 6 attack subpoenaed Biggs on May 12, 2022.

Biggs called the violence "tragic" but added that "there is suffering everywhere in the world" and the U.S. "can't be the military police for the entire world", claiming the resolution was a way to "put our foot in the door in Burma." The resolution was symbolic and did not call for use of force.In June 2021, Biggs was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.Biggs was one of 15 representatives to vote against H.R. 567: Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program Act of 2021, which would establish an interagency program to assist countries in North and West Africa to improve immediate and long-term capabilities to counter terrorist threats, and for other purposes.In July 2021, Biggs voted against the bipartisan ALLIES Act, which would increase by 8,000 the number of special immigrant visas for Afghan allies of the U.S. military during its invasion of Afghanistan, while also reducing some application requirements that caused long application backlogs; the bill passed the House, 407–16.In September 2021, Biggs was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.Biggs was among 19 House Republicans to vote against the final passage of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act.In February 2022, Biggs co-sponsored the Secure America's Borders First Act, which would prohibit the expenditure or obligation of military and security assistance to Kyiv over the U.S. border with Mexico.In 2022, Biggs voted against a bill to provide approximately $14 billion to the government of Ukraine.In July 2022, Biggs was one of 14 House Republicans to vote for an amendment that would have removed a proposed $37 billion spending increase in the defense budget.In July 2022, Biggs was one of 18 Republicans to vote against ratifying Sweden's and Finland's applications for NATO membership.In 2023, Biggs was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed President Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.

=== Climate change ===
In comments at an April 2017 constituent town hall, frequently interrupted by boos, Biggs rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, asserting in a halting answer, "There are credible scientists who say it exists; we aren't sure why", and "there are credible scientists who say it doesn't." Replying to a candidate survey from The Arizona Republic, Biggs wrote, "I do not believe climate change is occurring. I do not think that humans have a significant impact on climate. The federal government should stop regulating and stomping on our economy and freedoms in the name of a discredited theory." He submitted an amendment to the 2018 spending bill that would defund the National Climate Assessment and urged President Trump to withdraw from the Paris Accords. In February 2020, when Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy attempted to make a modest effort to gather the support of concerned young voters via a restrained approach to address climate change, Biggs and other hardline denialists objected. Biggs said: "People are like, 'Is this an official rollout? It can't be official. We didn't vote on it'."While factions of the Republican Party were split on whether to continue climate change denial, conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and the Competitive Enterprise Institute supported continuation. In 2018, Biggs was the sole House member to receive a 100% rating from the CFG.

Biggs opposes wearing masks to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, encouraging Arizonans not to wear them. In July 2020, he tweeted that people should not trust Anthony Fauci or Deborah Birx. He has called for the White House Coronavirus Task Force to be disbanded. During a major outbreak in the summer of 2020 in Arizona, Biggs questioned the hospitalization numbers and called Governor Doug Ducey's two-month lockdown a result of "hysteria" from "Democratic Leftists." In September 2020, Biggs posted a series of tweets supporting the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19. There is no strong evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.On March 4, 2020, Biggs and Ken Buck were the only two representatives to vote against an $8.3 billion COVID-19 aid package. Biggs called the bill "larded-up" and "bloated". Ten days later, he voted against the larger Coronavirus Response Act, saying that because it provided benefits to domestic partners, it "redefined the family."

=== Robert Mueller ===
On June 23, 2017, Biggs was one of three Republicans who called for the resignation of Robert Mueller, the prosecutor investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, on the grounds that Mueller could not conduct his investigation fairly because of events that happened when he was the acting director of the FBI.On March 19, 2018, Biggs renewed his call for Mueller to resign. On July 25, 2018, Biggs and nine other Republicans co-sponsored a resolution to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was Mueller's direct supervisor after the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.On April 8, 2019, The Arizona Republic published an op-ed by Biggs on the initial findings of the Mueller investigation. In it, Biggs called the investigation "an illegitimate attack on the executive branch" and wrote that the findings "demonstrate the weakness of the initial premise to investigate Trump, his family and campaign staff." He blamed the investigation on "the media that fueled this bogus attempt to overthrow the will of the American voter." Biggs's op-ed was published well ahead of the release of Mueller's full report on April 18, 2019, and was most likely written in response to a four-page summary of the report by Attorney General William Barr released on March 24. After the publication of the full report, Biggs posted a video on Twitter declaring that there was "no basis for an obstruction [of justice] charge" against Trump, chastising the Democratic party for attempting to "undermine the POTUS".
