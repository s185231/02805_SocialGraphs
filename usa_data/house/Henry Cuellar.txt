Enrique Roberto "Henry" Cuellar ( KWAY-ar; born September 19, 1955) is an American attorney and politician serving as the U.S. representative for Texas's 28th congressional district since 2005. He is a member of the Democratic Party. His district extends from the Rio Grande to San Antonio's suburbs.
Cuellar served in the Texas House of Representatives for 14 years, from 1987 to 2001, and briefly served as the Texas Secretary of State in 2001, making him, as of 2022, the most recent Democrat to have held a statewide office in Texas.
Cuellar was first elected to Congress in 2004, after defeating incumbent Ciro Rodriguez in a primary challenge. He is considered a leading centrist within the House Democratic Caucus. He has since been comfortably reelected in every general election while surviving a number of competitive primary races, most notably in 2020 and 2022.


== Early life and education ==
Cuellar was born in Laredo, the county seat of Webb County in South Texas, where he has resided most of his life. Both of his parents were Mexican American.
His father, Martin Siller Cuellar Sr. (1926–2019), was born in Tamaulipas, Mexico and immigrated to the United States. His mother was the former Odilia Perez (1928–2015), a native of Zapata, Texas.Cuellar attended Buenos Aires Elementary School, where he became an avid reader and graduated in 1973 from J. W. Nixon High School. He received an associate of arts degree from Laredo Community College, then known as Laredo Junior College, where he would later teach courses in government.
He then attended the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in foreign service. He also earned a Master of Arts in international trade from Texas A&M International University, a Juris Doctor (JD) from the University of Texas School of Law and a PhD from the University of Texas at Austin.As of 2023, he is finishing a master's in defense and strategic studies from Naval War College.


== Early career ==
In 1981, Cuellar opened his own law firm in Laredo and became a licensed customs broker in 1983. From 1984 to 1986 he taught at Texas A&M International University as an adjunct professor of international commercial law.


=== Texas House of Representatives ===
Cuellar was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1987 to 2001, representing most of Laredo. During his 14 years as a state representative, he served in leadership positions on the House Appropriations, Higher Education, and Calendar committees. He also served on several national legislative committees dealing with state budgets, the U.S.–Mexico border and international trade.


=== Texas Secretary of State ===
In 2001, Governor Rick Perry appointed Cuellar to be secretary of state of Texas. He served in the office for just over nine months until his resignation, after which Geoff Connor held the position in an acting capacity. As of 2023, Cuellar is the last Democrat to have served in the role.
During his short time as Texas Secretary of State, Cuellar issued an opinion that, while not legally binding, argued that home-rule cities in the state of Texas could not adopt ranked-choice voting for their elections under the Texas Constitution. That opinion has been the primary basis for the city of Austin ignoring the passage of the city's 2021 Proposition E, which would have adopted ranked-choice voting in Austin.

=== Elections ===


==== 2002 ====

In 2002, Cuellar was the Democratic nominee for the House of Representatives in Texas's 23rd congressional district. He lost to five-term incumbent Republican Henry Bonilla 52%–47% in the closest race Bonilla had faced up to that point.


==== 2004 ====

Cuellar spent much of early 2003 preparing for a rematch against Bonilla. However, redistricting shifted most of Laredo, which had been the heart of the 23rd since its creation in 1966, into the 28th district, represented by Ciro Rodriguez. Cuellar challenged Rodriguez, a former friend, for the nomination winning by 58 votes.The Washington Post described the campaign as "nasty". The initial count gave Rodriguez a 145-vote lead, but after a recount Cuellar led by 58 votes. Cuellar's victory was one of only two primary upsets of incumbents from either party in the entire country.
The 28th district was far more Democratic than the 23rd making him heavily favored in the general election. In November, he defeated the Republican by a 20-point margin, becoming the first Laredoan in over 20 years elected to represent the 28th district.
Cuellar's election to the House in 2004 was a standout for Democrats in a year in which Republicans otherwise gained seats in Texas's House delegation.


==== 2006 ====

On March 7, 2006, Cuellar again defeated Rodriguez in the Democratic primary with 52% of the vote in a three-way race. No Republican filed.
On June 29, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Texas Legislature had violated Latino voters' rights when it shifted most of Laredo out of the 23rd and replaced it with heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs. As a result, nearly every congressional district from El Paso to San Antonio had to be redrawn, and the primary results for these districts were invalidated. A court drew a new map in which all of Laredo was moved into the 28th district while the south San Antonio area was moved to the 23rd. An election open to all candidates with a runoff if no candidate won 50% was scheduled for the date of the general election, November 7, 2006.
In the general election on November 7, 2006, Cuellar had no Republican opposition. He handily defeated Ron Avery of McQueeney, the chairman of the conservative Constitution Party in Guadalupe County, and Democrat Frank Enriquez, a McAllen trial attorney, with nearly 68% of the vote.


==== 2008 ====

Cuellar was unopposed in the Democratic primary on March 4, 2008. In the general election, he outran President Barack Obama, winning nearly 70% of the vote to win reelection while the president won 56% in the district.


==== 2010 ====

Cuellar was unopposed for the Democratic nomination in 2010 and won reelection in the general election.


==== 2012 ====

Cuellar was opposed in the November 6 general election by Republican and Libertarian Party candidates.Guadalupe County, a Republican stronghold that usually opposed Cuellar for reelection, was removed from the reconfigured 28th district.Cuellar defeated the Republican, 112,262 votes (68%) to 49,095 votes (30%). Hisel took 2% of the vote, and a Green Party candidate received the remaining 1%.


==== 2014 ====

Cuellar was unopposed in the Democratic primary and faced no Republican opposition in 2014.


==== 2016 ====

Cuellar won a rematch in the March 1, 2016, Democratic primary with former Republican congressional candidate William R. Hayward, who switched parties to run again for the House. Cuellar received 49,962 votes (89.8%) to Hayward's 5,682 (10.2%). Cuellar then defeated Republican Zeffen Patrick Hardin in the November 8 general election, 122,086 (66.2%) to 57,740 (31.3%). Green Party nominee Michael D. Cary received 4,616 votes (2.5%).


==== 2018 ====

In 2018, Cuellar was unopposed in the Democratic primary. He won 84.4% (117,178 votes) in the general election.


==== 2020 ====

On January 11, 2019, the progressive organization Justice Democrats, which supported U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's successful 2018 primary campaign in New York City, announced that it was seeking a primary challenger against Cuellar in the Democratic primary scheduled for March 4, 2020. On July 13, 2019, the Justice Democrats organization announced its support for Jessica Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration and human rights attorney from Laredo who had announced a primary campaign against Cuellar. Cuellar defeated Cisneros 51.8% to 48.2% in the primary. He won the general election in November with 58.3% of the vote, defeating Republican nominee Sandra Whitten and Libertarian nominee Bekah Congdon.


==== 2022 ====

Cuellar finished first with a plurality in the Democratic primary, tallying 23,552 votes, 48.4%, over Cisneros, who received 22,745 votes, 46.9%. Cuellar and Cisneros qualified for the May runoff while a third candidate, Tannya Benavides, was eliminated after getting 2,289 votes (4.7%).During the runoff, Cuellar faced renewed scrutiny over an incident in 2018 where he fired a pregnant staffer who had requested parental leave and subsequently suffered a miscarriage, and according to court documents, subsequently urged other staffers to help him discredit her.On June 7, trailing by 281 votes in the runoff, Cisneros requested a recount to be conducted by the Texas Democratic Party. Cuellar extended his lead to a 289-vote margin during the recount. The Associated Press called the race on June 21, 2022. Cuellar went on to easily win reelection against the Republican nominee.

He denounced inclusion in the Senate immigration bill of an amendment sponsored by Senators Bob Corker and John Hoeven that called for 700 additional miles of border fencing, calling the fence an antiquated solution to a modern problem.

In 2011, he delivered federal funding to open a Veterans Administration outpatient clinic operated jointly with UT Health San Antonio in Laredo, Texas. At the time, the mayor declared that the project "would not have been possible" without the Congressman's support.In 2020, Cuellar secured $1.2 million in federal funding to support efforts to fight COVID-19 in Webb County.
