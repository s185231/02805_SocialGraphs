==== Firearm incident ====
At a public meeting for constituents on April 6, 2018, Norman engaged in a conversation with representatives from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America (MDA).

According to Norman, the loaded firearm was visible for "maybe a minute, or two minutes" and was never pointed at any individual, but MDA representatives who were seated at the table with Norman said the firearm was visible for "five to 10 minutes" and that they felt unsafe. Norman holds a concealed weapons permit issued by South Carolina.The incident sparked widespread criticism of Norman.
