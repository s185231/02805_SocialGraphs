=== Elections ===
While at MIT, Kaptur was recruited to run for Congress in 1982 against freshman Republican Ed Weber, who had upset 26-year incumbent Lud Ashley two years earlier. Despite being outspent by almost 3–1, she defeated Weber 58–39%.In 1984, Kaptur faced a strong challenge from Republican Frank Venner, longtime anchorman and weatherman at WTVG, but defeated him 55–44%, even as Ronald Reagan carried the district. From 1986 to 2002, she won every election with at least 74% of the vote. In 2004, she faced her strongest challenger in 20 years in Lucas County auditor Larry Kaczala, but won the election 68–32%.
2006
Kaptur won her 13th term with 74% of the vote.
2008
Kaptur won her 14th term with 74% of the vote.
2010
Shortly after achieving fame during the 2008 election, conservative figure Samuel "Joe the Plumber" Wurzelbacher announced that he was considering challenging Kaptur in the 2010 election,
but chose not to run. Kaptur was instead challenged by Republican Rich Iott, a Tea Party movement favorite. She was reelected to a 15th term with 59% of the vote, her closest victory since 1984.

2012
For her first three decades in Congress, Kaptur represented a compact district centered around Toledo. Redistricting after the 2010 census extended the 9th district to western Cleveland. The new map put the home of incumbent 10th district congressman Dennis Kucinich into the 9th, so they ran against each other in the Democratic primary. Graham Veysey, a small-business owner from Cleveland, also ran in the primary. Retaining over 60% of her former territory, Kaptur won the primary with 56% of the vote to Kucinich's 40%. In the general election, she won a 16th term against Wurzelbacher and Libertarian Sean Stipe. The reconfigured 9th was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Kaptur had effectively clinched reelection by defeating Kucinich in the primary.


==== 2014 ====

Kaptur's 2014 opponent was Richard May, a longtime Republican activist from west Cleveland, who beat Lakewood resident Robert C. Horrocks Jr. in the May 6 primary. Kaptur won 68–32%.


==== 2016 ====

Kaptur's 2016 opponent was Donald Larson, who defeated Steven Kraus and Joel Lieske in the Republican primary on March 15. Kaptur won 68–31%.


==== 2020 ====

Kaptur's 2020 opponent was Rob Weber, who defeated Charles W. Barrett, Tim Connors, and Timothy P. Corrigan in the Republican primary on March 17. Kaptur won 63–37%.


==== 2022 ====

Kaptur was seemingly placed in a vulnerable position when redistricting shifted her district to the west in order to take in territory previously in the neighboring heavily Republican 5th district. While Joe Biden carried the old 9th with 59% of the vote, the new 9th would have voted for Donald Trump with 51% of the vote. Despite this, Kaptur defeated Republican nominee J.R. Majewski, 56% to 43%.


=== Tenure ===

Kaptur opposed the America Invents Act that passed into law and changed the U.S. Patent System. She opposed changing from a "first to invent system" to a "first to file system", saying it hurt small businesses and "Our patent system is the finest in the world... the proposed solutions are special fixes that benefit these few giants at the expense of everyone else."Kaptur co-sponsored the Restoring America's Leadership in Innovation Act.

It was not voted on before the end of the session and so failed to be enacted. Kaptur introduced similar legislation twice in 1989 but these bills also failed to become law.Kaptur introduced legislation for the fourth time on January 27, 1993. This time the legislation was voted on and passed in the House on May 10, 1993. After a companion bill was passed in the United States Senate, President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law on May 25, 1993.Kaptur later said that she felt "a great sense of fulfillment" that the memorial was built. "This generation was the most unselfish America has ever seen," she said. "They never asked anybody for anything in return."


==== Abortion ====

Kaptur voted for the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009.

She voted against the Child Custody Protection Act in 1999 and the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act in 2005. Kaptur voted against allowing privately funded abortions at overseas military hospitals twice in 1995, as well as in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2005, Kaptur voted to lift the ban on abortions at overseas military hospitals.In 2023, Kaptur voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would have criminalized failing to provide care for an infant born alive after an abortion attempt.

==== 2008 economic crisis ====
Kaptur opposed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which provided a bailout for U.S. banks.

== Personal life ==
Kaptur is a Roman Catholic. In her letter to NETWORK Lobby, she wrote: "The Roman Catholic faith is a central pillar of my being, particularly as an American of Polish heritage". She describes her Catholicism as an element of her Polish heritage, stating that the Catholic Church gave her "ancestors worth and hope — during times of bondage, repression, punishment, war, illness, and harrowing economic downturns". Kaptur also expressed her admiration for Catholic social teaching, especially the option for the poor. In 2010, Kaptur withheld her vote on Affordable Care Act until being assured that it would not fund abortion. Because she mixes Political Catholicism with her progressive persona, The Washington Post described her as "an economic populist from America’s heartland with progressive values and a conservative disposition".
