== 2006 U.S. Senate campaign ==

Kean was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat vacated by former U.S. senator and former governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine, a seat now filled by Corzine's designated replacement, Bob Menendez. Kean won the June 6, 2006, primary against John P. Ginty by a 3–1 margin. He lost the general election to Menendez, 53.3% to 44.3%. The race was the narrowest victory for an incumbent Democrat in the U.S. in an election that saw Democrats retake control of the Senate as part of a nationwide backlash against the Bush administration. Kean was endorsed by The Courier-Post, The Press of Atlantic City, and Asbury Park Press.

=== Elections ===


==== 2000 ====

Kean sought the Republican nomination for New Jersey's 7th congressional district, but lost the primary to Mike Ferguson by about 4,000 votes, finishing second in a field of four candidates.


==== 2020 ====

On April 16, 2019, Kean announced that he was running for New Jersey's 7th congressional district in 2020, challenging first-term Democratic incumbent Tom Malinowski. In the first quarter of 2019, Kean nearly matched Malinowski's fundraising total of over $500,000. In August 2019, Kean was endorsed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kean won the Republican primary over token opposition, and narrowly lost to Malinowski in the general election. It was the closest House race in New Jersey and one of the closest in the country; due to the close margin and slow counting of mail-in and provisional ballots, the outcome remained in doubt until nearly two weeks after the election.


==== 2022 ====

Kean announced in February 2021 that he would not seek reelection to the State Senate and immediately became the subject of speculation that he was preparing to run for New Jersey's 7th congressional district again. Malinowski was under scrutiny after his failure to disclose more than 100 stock trades became a national news story and led to a complaint filed with the House Ethics Committee. In redistricting, the 7th district was made more Republican while the neighboring 11th and 5th districts became more solidly Democratic. Kean formally announced his campaign on July 14, 2021, joined by U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. He won the Republican primary in June 2022 and the general election with 51.8% (156,414 votes) to Malinowski's 48.2% (145,253 votes).


=== Tenure ===
Kean is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, and joined the Problem Solvers Caucus, a centrist House caucus. The caucus has led him to cooperate with other members of Congress from New Jersey, such as Democrats Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill. Kean said he joined the caucus to assure constituents that he remains committed to "working across the aisle". He is a moderate Republican, though detractors have said he could have done more to distance himself from the politics of President Trump. Critics have called Kean out for holding "Telephone Town Halls", especially Sue Altman, the executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance. Others counter that Kean's lesser media presence is a strength. Fred Snowflack of Insider New Jersey reported, "Dating back to last fall’s campaign, most of those griping about Kean’s incommunicado ways were the media and voters who probably were not going to support him anyway".
