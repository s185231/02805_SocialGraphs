=== Elections ===


==== 2016 ====

In 2016, Craig ran for the United States House of Representatives in Minnesota's 2nd congressional district. She announced her candidacy before Republican incumbent John Kline announced his retirement. She faced no opposition in the Democratic primary. In the general election, she faced former conservative talk show host Jason Lewis. She lost by fewer than 7,000 votes.


==== 2018 ====

Craig sought a rematch with Lewis in 2018. As in 2016, she was unopposed in the Democratic primary. In the general election, she defeated Lewis, whose candor was felt to be his eventual undoing. Regarding slavery, for instance, he said in 2016, "If you don't want to own a slave, don't, but don't tell other people they can't."Craig is the first openly lesbian mother to be elected to Congress, the first woman to be elected in Minnesota's 2nd district, and the first openly gay person elected to Congress from Minnesota. She received 52.6% of the vote, winning three of the six counties in the district. When she took office on January 3, 2019, she became the first DFLer to represent this district since it was reconfigured as a south suburban district in 2003.


==== 2020 ====

In a verified recording, Legal Marijuana Now Party nominee Adam Weeks said that Republican operatives offered him $15,000 to run for Congress in the 2nd district in order to "pull votes away" from Craig. Weeks said, "They want me to run as a third-party, liberal candidate, which I'm down. I can play the liberal, you know that." Leaders of prominent pro-marijuana legalization groups Minnesotans for Responsible Marijuana Regulation, Sensible Change Minnesota, and Minnesota NORML condemned the GOP strategy as "unconscionable".In late September, Weeks died of a drug overdose, throwing the election into chaos. Minnesota law requires a special election if a major-party nominee dies within 79 days of Election Day. The law was enacted to prevent a repeat of the circumstances of the 2002 U. S. Senate election, in which incumbent Paul Wellstone died 11 days before the general election. Since the Legal Marijuana Now Party was a major party in Minnesota (by virtue of its 2018 candidate for state auditor winning five percent of the vote), the 2nd District race was set to be postponed to February 9, 2021. Craig sued to keep the election on November 3, arguing that the requirement for a special election could leave the 2nd district without representation for almost a month, and also violated federal election law. Republican nominee Tyler Kistner joined the Minnesota Secretary of State as a defendant. The federal judge hearing the case ruled for Craig, noting that federal election law barred moving the date of House elections in all but a few circumstances. Kistner appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which also sided with Craig. The appeals court held that the death of a candidate from a party with "modest electoral strength" could not justify postponing the election. After Kistner's appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected, the election was cleared to continue as scheduled on November 3.


==== 2022 ====

In the 2022 election, Craig defeated Republican nominee Tyler Kistner in a rematch of the 2020 election with 51% of the vote.

=== Physical assault ===

I got attacked by someone who the District of Columbia has not prosecuted fully over the course of almost a decade, over the course of 12 assaults before mine that morning... And so I think we have to think about how in the world can we make sure that we're not just letting criminals out... I mean, it wasn't even in every instance that he got 10 days or 30 days. Many times, the charges were completely dropped before any justice was achieved at all... I was assault number 13 on his record... And I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure there's not a 14, a 15, a 20... If you throw somebody in jail for 10 days and think, "There's your punishment, and we're gonna let you right back on the street," what the hell do you think's gonna happen?
