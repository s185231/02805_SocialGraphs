Caucus staffers including the executive director quit before she assumed leadership. Barragán hired a well-respected congressional staffer as caucus executive director but fired her a month into her tenure, the cause being an email the executive director sent about the House and Senate floor schedule that Barragán was unhappy with, a person familiar with the situation told The Washington Post. The dismissal, combined with earlier resignations, left the caucus without staff.
