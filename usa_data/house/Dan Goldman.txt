On June 1, 2022, Goldman announced his candidacy for United States Congress in New York's 10th district. A July 14 poll by Data for Progress indicated Goldman had 12% of support, behind Councilwoman Carlina Rivera's 17% and Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou's 14% in the crowded Democratic primary, which also included incumbent congressman Mondaire Jones and former congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. An internal poll conducted between July 22 and 26 showed Goldman leading the race with 18% of support, followed by Niou with 16% and Rivera with 14%. Goldman has been endorsed by New York State Assemblymember Robert Carroll and Brian A. Cunningham, former U.S. Representative Steve Israel, former Lieutenant Governor of New York Richard Ravitch and The New York Times. He received a backhanded endorsement from Donald Trump, who called him "very compassionate and compromising to those within the Republican Party", which Goldman's campaign rejected as a "pathetic attempt at fooling Democrats".Goldman raised more than $1.2 million from more than 2,100 individual contributions in the month after he declared his candidacy.

He received maximum allowable campaign contributions from billionaire real estate developers Douglas Durst and Stephen M. Ross. Ross was also a major fundraiser and supporter of Trump.
