In February 2020, Moore declared his candidacy for Utah's 1st congressional district in the 2020 elections. In a field of 12 primary candidates, Moore advanced out of the Republican nominating convention in second place, together with Weber County Commissioner Kerry Gibson. Two other candidates, Davis County commissioner Bob Stevenson and Kaysville mayor Katie Witt, also secured their spot in the primary by gathering signatures. During the party nominating process, Moore was criticized for not living within the congressional district. At the time, he resided on the east bench of Salt Lake City, 15 miles outside the district.
