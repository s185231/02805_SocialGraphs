=== Elections ===


==== 2022 ====
In 2021, Luttrell filed to run as a Republican for Texas's 8th congressional district in the 2022 election to succeed retiring incumbent Kevin Brady.During his campaign, Luttrell was supported by Rick Perry, Congressman Dan Crenshaw (also a retired Navy SEAL), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the Congressional Leadership Fund, and the American Patriots PAC, which was founded by McCarthy allies. He garnered some notoriety from his brother Marcus, a veteran and the author of the memoir Lone Survivor. In total, there were 11 candidates in the Republican primary, but Luttrell and Christian Collins, a conservative activist, were identified as the primary contenders since they both received significant political endorsements. Collins was supported by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, the House Freedom action fund, and avid Trump supporters such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn. The Texas Tribune described the race as "a tense proxy war, with some of the best-known Republicans in Texas—and the country—split between two of the leading candidates." Luttrell has expressed support for Trump, but he did request and receive campaign funds from a political PAC run by Adam Kinzinger, a major critic of Trump. Luttrell and Collins ran on similar issues—securing the border, gun rights, and restricting abortion—but Collins attempted to portray himself as the more pro-Trump candidate, accusing Luttrell of "lining up with the establishment". Donald Trump did not make an endorsement in the race.Luttrell won the Republican primary with 52.2% of the vote, avoiding a runoff with Collins, who placed second with 22%. The Democratic nominee in the general election was Laura Jones, the former Democratic Party chair of San Jacinto County.  Luttrell joined a lawsuit with several other congressional Republican candidates to remove Libertarian Party candidates, who are often perceived as threatening to Republican chances in tight elections, from the ballot. FiveThirtyEight rated Luttrell "very likely" to win the election. He was endorsed by the editorial board of the Houston Chronicle. On November 8, 2022, Luttrell defeated Jones in the general election by 68% to 31%.
