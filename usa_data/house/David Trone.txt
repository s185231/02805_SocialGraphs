David John Trone (born September 21, 1955) is an American politician and businessman serving as the U.S. representative for Maryland's 6th congressional district. The district includes most of the western third of the state, but the bulk of its population is in the outer northern suburbs of Washington, D.C. Trone founded and co-owns Total Wine & More with his brother, and served as the company's president until December 2016.In 2016, Trone spent more than $13 million of his own money on his unsuccessful Democratic primary campaign to succeed Chris Van Hollen in Maryland's 8th congressional district, setting a record for the most expensive self-funded House campaign. In 2018, Trone was the Democratic nominee for the 6th district and won the general election to succeed John Delaney.
Trone is currently a candidate for the United States Senate in the 2024 election to succeed Ben Cardin.


== Early life and education ==
Trone was born in Maryland and raised on a 200-acre (81 ha) farm in East Berlin, Pennsylvania, where his father Thomas ran a chicken and hog operation. Thomas also owned a soda and beer store. When Trone's parents separated, his father kept the farm and his mother took over the store. Thomas and his farm went into bankruptcy, but Trone kept working at his mother's store.Trone graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, from Furman University in 1977, and earned a Master of Business Administration in 1985 from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.


== Career ==


=== Total Wine & More ===

Having seen the potential of the beer sales at his mother's store, Trone began his career by founding the beer-only retailer Beer World in Pennsylvania in 1984, during his second semester of graduate school. Months before graduating from Wharton, in 1985, Trone expanded into the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Over time, he opened additional stores, called Beer and Pop Warehouse and, later, Beer World, which were owned by friends and family members because Pennsylvania state law prohibited individuals from owning more than one beer retail outlet.Trone, with his brother Robert's help, opened two stores in Delaware in 1991, adding wine and spirits to the company's offerings. Using knowledge acquired at Wharton, the brothers chose to replicate the family store's model across Pennsylvania. The beverage company had slim margins, but was immediately profitable and allowed the brothers to focus on operations. They familiarized themselves with regulators and industry leaders, and began changing laws that restrict wholesalers from offering retailers discounts in exchange for large volume purchases, among others, in their attempt to promote beverage consumption.The business has since expanded into what is known today as Total Wine & More, the largest privately owned beer, wine, and spirits retailer in the U.S.  In December 2016, Trone gave up his title of president to chief executive Kevin Peters. He has continued to make money from Total Wine & More while in Congress, reporting more than $110 million in personal income during his tenure.


==== Lobbying efforts ====
Under Trone's tenure, Total Wine lobbied against state laws that prevented the company from selling below cost, including in Connecticut and Massachusetts, where the company temporarily had its license suspended for refusing to comply with such laws. According to lobbying records analyzed by The Baltimore Sun, Trone spent over $1.4 million lobbying state governments to overturn or weaken what the company said were "anti-consumer laws passed after Prohibition". The company saw success with these efforts in various states, including Minnesota, Texas, and the Carolinas. Trone also gave more than $240,000 in campaign contributions to various politicians, most of which went toward Republican candidates including Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, and North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, which he said in January 2016 was to "buy access" to these politicians. His political contributions were later criticized by his opponents in the 2016 Democratic primary in Maryland's 8th congressional district.Total Wine & More brought these efforts before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2019, who ruled for Total Wine & More in Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Assn. v. Thomas, overturning the state's residency requirement for obtaining a license to operate a liquor store and thereby allowing the company to expand into Tennessee. In July 2023, The American Prospect reported that Total Wine & More sought to impede on a Federal Trade Commission investigation into alleged violations of the Robinson–Patman Act, which prohibits anti-competitive price discrimination, in alcohol markets.During the 2020 and 2022 election cycles, Trone made campaign contributions towards various Republican candidates through his firm, Retail Services and Systems, including toward Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and groups that sought to elect Republicans to the Wisconsin Legislature. He defended these contributions in a statement to Time, pointing out his combined $23 million in donations to various Democratic candidates and the American Civil Liberties Union, and later told Jewish Insider that the contributions were necessary to "protect [the company] from attack".During the 2022 general elections in Massachusetts and Colorado, the Trone brothers spent almost $3 million on media against Question 3, which would lower the number of alcohol beverage licenses retailers could have in the state, and an additional $2 million financing a campaign to support Proposition 124, which would have allowed Total Wine & More to open an unlimited number of Colorado stores by 2037. Both ballot initiative were defeated by voters, by a margin of 62 to 38 percent in Colorado and a margin of 55 to 45 in Massachusetts.


==== Arrests and indictments ====
Beginning in 1989 and over the next three years, Pennsylvania authorities arrested Trone three times following complaints from an association of smaller, individually owned stores. One arrest was for negotiating volume discounts on behalf of multiple stores and illegally advertising beer prices, and one was for circumventing state transportation regulations. The charges were later dismissed.In 1992, a grand jury in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, indicted Trone, his wife, June, and his brother for owning multiple stores through Trone's consulting company, among other charges, all of which were later dropped and expunged. In 1994, a state judge dismissed 19 of the 23 counts based on "prosecutorial overreaching", and the remaining counts were withdrawn after Trone paid a $40,000 fee to cover investigation costs.During these legal proceedings, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) broke the law by providing records of his consulting firm to government officials, prompting Trone to sue the agency in federal court. He won and was awarded $400,000. The lawyer who had represented Trone also served as a national board member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which began a long-term relationship between Trone and the ACLU. The Trones' difficulties in Pennsylvania prompted them to leave the state; Total Wine & More grew from the remaining two stores in Delaware and an additional retail outlet in New Jersey, which Trone had opened in the early 1990s.In 2016, the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission served Total Wine with a license suspension for selling liquor below its costs. The company appealed the commission's decision, and in 2017 the Suffolk Superior Court sided with Total Wine.

=== Elections ===


==== 2016 ====

Trone has been active in Democratic politics and hosted fundraisers for the party. In 2014, he hosted a fundraiser for gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown that former president Bill Clinton attended, and in November 2015, he held a fundraiser at his home for the Democratic National Committee, which President Obama attended. Trone also contributed to Republican politicians; according to OpenSecrets, he donated more than $150,000 to Republicans in multiple U.S. states between 2000 and 2015. The Washington Post reported that Trone contributed more than $90,000 to Democratic state officials during the same period, and said the donations made to Republicans were to support "legislation or regulatory changes favorable to his company". Trone said the donations "represented the cost of doing business, especially in states with Republican-controlled state houses and governor's mansions".In January 2016, Trone entered the Democratic primary campaign to succeed Chris Van Hollen in Maryland's 8th congressional district; this was the real contest in the heavily Democratic district. He ran on reducing unemployment and gun violence, criminal justice reform, environmental protection, and education and foreign policy. Trone pledged to support early education, work with the National Institutes of Health to reduce health care costs, improve infrastructure, and forgive more student loans for government employees.Trone spent more than $13 million on his unsuccessful campaign, which became the most expensive self-funded House campaign ever. The first-time candidate said a large personal investment was necessary in order to stand out in a crowded race that included well-known rivals, including news anchor and Marriott International executive Kathleen Matthews and the winner, State Senator Jamie Raskin. After the election, Trone told NPR, "We knew it would be very expensive. We're not surprised by what it cost at all. We anticipated that, and it was a thoughtful choice my wife and I made... It was the right decision to take no money from anybody."


==== 2018 ====

On August 2, 2017, Trone announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Maryland's 6th district, an open seat being vacated by John Delaney, who chose not to seek reelection and retire from Congress to focus on his 2020 presidential campaign.

He told Washington Jewish Week in early 2018 that lessons learned from his previous run included entering the race earlier and raising money.Trone toured Maryland in late 2017, and filed his candidacy in January 2018. His filing was accompanied by a press release expressing his support for education, environmental protections, health care, Social Security, and women's rights. Trone  also made combating the opioid epidemic a central focus of his platform, releasing an action plan and hosting a series of town hall meetings to address the crisis.

Upon his entry, the Democratic primary quickly developed into a contest between money and endorsements, with Trone loaning his campaign $9.8 million and outspending his closest competitor, Angela Alsobrooks, by 10-to-1. During the campaign, Trone sought to present himself as a "progressive Democrat", citing his philantrophic activities and hiring practices at Total Wine & More, and targeted voters in the Baltimore metropolitan area and Montgomery County with a platform focused on drug costs, systemic racism, and abortion. He also received endorsements from many of his colleagues in the House and from elected officials within his district.

Lamone struck down Maryland's redistricting plan as unconstitutionally gerrymandered. Trone later defended Maryland's congressional map during an appeal of the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, submitting an amicus brief to the court in February 2019. In March 2019, Trone criticized Governor Larry Hogan's proposed redraw of Maryland's congressional maps—which saw Maryland's sixth congressional district redrawn to include Frederick and Carroll counties, thereby making it more favorable to Republicans—calling his proposal "not germane".In March 2022, after Maryland's congressional maps were redrawn following a court ruling that struck down the state's previous maps, Trone praised the court ruling as "moving the state away from partisan gerrymandering" and again called for national redistricting reform.

He called on the country to increase enforcement of its anti-money laundering laws and to prevent manufacturers from exporting precursor chemicals to Mexico through cooperation with U.S. agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Office of National Drug Control Policy. He also encouraged the United States to increase its education, treatment, and prevention programs, calling it "the only chance we've got".In January 2023, Trone sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling on him to refuse negotiations with China on other topics until the country promised to do more to curb the fentanyl crisis.
