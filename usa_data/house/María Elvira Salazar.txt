== Journalism ==
Salazar's journalism career began in 1983 as a general assignment reporter for Channel 23. In 1984, she served as senior political correspondent for the National News in Spanish television in the U.S. for the Spanish International Network, which later became Univision. In 1988, she began working as a White House and Pentagon correspondent for Univision. In 1991, she became the bureau chief at the Central America division of Univision while covering the war in El Salvador.In 1993, Salazar started working for the Telemundo Network, serving later as senior political correspondent for Telemundo in Cuba. In 1995, she interviewed Fidel Castro for Telemundo at the Cuban mission to the UN. She is said to have been the only U.S. Spanish-language television journalist to interview Castro one-on-one.In 1996, she was one of the two Hispanic journalists to participate in the only political debate in the 50 years after the Cuban revolution between two politically active figures: Ricardo Alarcon, the president of the National Cuban Assembly, and Jorge Mas Canosa, the founder and president of the Cuban American National Foundation and one of the most famous supporters of the anti-Castro movement.Salazar worked at Telemundo until 2002, when she continued her career as a journalist with America TV 41 with her own political news show, Maria Elvira Confronta. In 2003, she moved to Channel 22.
In 2006, Raul Alarcon, owner of Spanish Broadcasting System (SBS), purchased channel 22, and the channel is now known as Mega TV. Salazar changed the name of her program to Polo Opuestos under the new owners. She maintained the debate dynamic of her show, but renamed it Maria Elvira Live!.She interviewed several actors of the telenovela Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord, including the imprisoned Escobar lieutenant John Jairo Velásquez.Salazar has said that after her interview with Castro, her second-biggest TV interview was with the former Chilean president Augusto Pinochet in 2003. Chilean Judge Juan Guzman cited the interview as a legal basis to rule Pinochet "mentally competent to stand trial for human rights violations".On 2013, Salazar interviewed Cuban dissident and blogger Yoani Sánchez in New York City.Salazar has interviewed several public figures, including Presidents Bill Clinton (1999) and George W. Bush (2001), Mexican Presidents Vicente Fox and Carlos Salinas de Gortari (2005), Spanish President José María Aznar (2007), Colombian Presidents Alvaro Uribe (2008) and Juan Manuel Santos (2014), and Mother Teresa.She has frequently appeared as a guest on Fox News television programs such as Fox & Friends, The O'Reilly Factor, Tucker Carlson Tonight, Hannity and The Ingraham Angle, as well as Mornings with Maria on the Fox Business Network and on the conservative network Newsmax, sometimes stylized under the name Elvira Salazar. Among her topics of discussion are immigration, border security and the fight against socialism.
In 2016, Salazar returned to Mega TV as the anchor of the night newscast.

=== Elections ===


==== 2018 ====

The Miami Herald reported in January 2018 that retiring Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican who had represented the 27th congressional district since 1989, had met with Salazar. Ros-Lehtinen said that her district was "totally winnable for the right candidate" from the Republican Party, adding that Salazar "could be the right candidate."In March 2018, Salazar announced her candidacy to represent the district, which includes Miami Beach, most of Miami, Kendall, and parts of coastal south Dade County. The traditionally Republican district, which includes wealthy communities like Miami Beach, Key Biscayne and Coral Gables as well as Little Havana in Miami, had been trending Democratic in recent years.Salazar's Republican primary opponent, Dade County Commissioner Bruno Barreiro, criticized her for her 1995 interview with Fidel Castro, in which she called Castro a "comandante", as well as a 2016 appearance on Fox News where she called Barack Obama's rapprochement with Cuba "noble". Salazar called Barreiro's attack advertising "defamatory", saying, "I have been one of the staunchest, most hardest critics of the Cuban Revolution on the air."On August 28, 2018, Salazar won the Republican primary by a margin of about 15 points over Barreiro, her leading rival. Former Clinton cabinet member Donna Shalala won the Democratic nomination for the seat. The only debates held during the general election campaign were in Spanish. Shalala does not speak Spanish and used an interpreter, giving Salazar an advantage. Each candidate declined opportunities to debate the other in English due to scheduling conflicts. Although Hillary Clinton had won the district by almost 20 points in 2016 – Clinton's best showing in a Republican-held district – polling as late as a month before Election Day showed Salazar either narrowly ahead or statistically tied with Shalala. Salazar lost to Shalala, who received about 52% of the vote.


==== 2020 ====

In August 2019, Salazar announced her candidacy to run in a rematch against Shalala. She was endorsed by President Donald Trump, won the August 2020 Republican primary, and faced Shalala in the November general election. The Cook Political Report, as well as various polling firms, classified the seat as "Likely Democratic", but Salazar won, 51.4% to 48.6%. She was one of 19 new Republican women elected to the House of Representatives in the 2020 elections. Politico reported that Shalala attributed Salazar's strength to the potency of the socialism attacks among Miami's Cuban population, aided by Shalala calling herself a "pragmatic socialist".

In late 2020, Salazar was identified as a participant in the Freedom Force, a group of incoming Republican House members who "say they're fighting against socialism in America". Due to her COVID-19 quarantine, Salazar missed voting on certifying the presidential election results in the House on January 6, 2021. On January 12, the day she was sworn in to Congress, Salazar voted against removing Trump via the 25th Amendment. On January 13, she voted against Trump's second impeachment.On February 4, 2021, Salazar was one of 11 Republicans who voted to strip Marjorie Taylor Greene of her House Education and Labor Committee and House Budget Committee assignments in response to controversial statements she had made about school shootings at Parkland and Sandy Hook, among other things. She released a statement on her vote, saying in part, "As I have repeatedly criticized Ilhan Omar for her anti-Semitic comments, I had to hold Marjorie Taylor Greene accountable for her denial of the Parkland Massacre, the Flight 77 crash, and accusing a Jewish family of starting the California wildfires. From now on, I will hold every Democrat to this new standard that they have created."On May 19, 2021, Salazar joined 34 other Republicans and all Democrats in voting to approve the creation of the January 6 commission.
