Before his election to Congress, Newhouse served as director of the Washington State Department of Agriculture and as a member of the Washington House of Representatives. He is a member of the Republican Party.

=== Elections ===
In February 2014, Newhouse entered the Republican primary for Washington's 4th congressional district. The incumbent, Doc Hastings, did not run. Newhouse and fellow Republican Clint Didier advanced to the November election after finishing in the top two in the August primary, marking the first time that two Republicans squared off in a general election since the state adopted the "top two" primary system. The 4th has long been Washington's most conservative district, and it was very likely that Hastings would be succeeded by another Republican.
The race was very close, and was seen as a battle between the factions of the GOP; Newhouse is considered a mainstream Republican, while Didier openly identified with the Tea Party movement. Newhouse defeated Didier by a margin of 51%-49%.Newhouse faced Didier in a rematch in 2016, placing first in the blanket primary with 44,720 votes (45.77%) to Didier's 26,892 (27.53%). In the general election, Newhouse defeated Didier, 132,517 votes (57.64%) to 97,402 (42.36%).


=== Tenure ===
In December 2020, Newhouse was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
Although he had voted against impeachment in the first impeachment of Donald Trump, Newhouse announced his support for the second impeachment of Donald Trump on January 13, 2021, after the storming of the United States Capitol. In a statement, Newhouse condemned the "hateful and anti-American extremists" who attacked the Capitol, saying that they had been incited by "the language and misinformation of the President of the United States." He claimed that he could not appear to condone the "unacceptable violence" or Trump's "inaction" by voting against impeachment, saying that Trump "failed to fulfill his oath of office" by not responding sooner. He voted to impeach alongside nine other Republicans that day. In his speech supporting impeachment, Newhouse said that while the article charging Trump with incitement of insurrection was "flawed", he also believed there was "no excuse" for Trump's failure to act. He expressed regret for not speaking out sooner against Trump's spreading of election misinformation. Earlier, he told The Spokesman-Review that while he was a Trump supporter, he believed Trump "let us down" by not doing more to stop the violence.On May 19, 2021, Newhouse became one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.
