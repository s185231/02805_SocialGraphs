== Political positions ==


=== Healthcare ===
Bilirakis supports repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.On February 11, 2017, Bilirakis hosted a townhall in Pasco County, Florida, where he was faced with several protesters angry over the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act, when a member of the local party (an unauthorized speaker for the county REC), Bill Akins repeated the now debunked claim that the ACA contains "what is effectively known as death panels". Bilirakis nodded in agreement and later told CNN, "The board exists, OK? And I've voted to repeal the board." Bilirakis seemed to equate the "death panel" with the Independent Advisory Board, a 15-member committee that issues recommendations for reducing healthcare costs, subject to congressional oversight and approval.In early October 2018, Bilirakis released a campaign advertisement touting his work fighting opioids in Pasco County, Florida. In the advertisement, he took credit for a law he did not have a hand in crafting. The 30-second ad flashed text about a "Bilirakis INTERDICT ACT" as Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said Bilirakis is "giving us the tools to do our job and get traffickers off the street". The INTERDICT Act provides funding and equipment to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for detecting imported fentanyl. But Bilirakis was neither a sponsor nor one of 18 co-sponsors, making it unclear how it is the "Bilirakis INTERDICT Act".

No action had been taken as of March 2018.In the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018, Bilirakis said that he would be willing to consider gun control legislation, "if that's what it takes". He said that, specifically, he would support more school resource officers in schools. He also announced his support for legislation that would ensure "that those who are mentally ill do not have access to weapons".

Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.In an editorial, the Tampa Bay Times wrote that Bilirakis "chose partisan games over national interest". The Orlando Sentinel published an editorial calling the signers of the amicus brief a "national embarrassment", a "danger to democracy", and the "Sedition Caucus". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion".Many of the signers of the Texas v. Pennsylvania amicus brief objected to the certification of the 2020 Electoral College vote, but Bilirakis was absent due to contracting COVID-19.As a result of the 2021 United States Capitol attack, the House of Representatives impeached Trump a second time. Bilirakis voted against impeachment, calling it "politically motivated" and a "highly polarizing ruse that will only further divide Americans".
