Lloyd Kenneth Smucker (born January 23, 1964) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative from Pennsylvania's 11th congressional district, which includes Lancaster County and most of southern York County. He is a member of the Republican Party and represented the 16th district until the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew it in 2018 due to gerrymandering. He was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 13th district from 2009 to 2016.


== Biography ==
Smucker was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, to Daniel and Arie Smucker. At the time of his birth, the family belonged to the Old Order Amish, but they left the community when he was five years old. After graduating from Lancaster Mennonite High School in 1981, he attended Lebanon Valley College and Franklin & Marshall College, where he earned credits in liberal arts but did not complete a degree. For 25 years, he served as president of the Smucker Company, a family-owned commercial construction firm in Smoketown that received $4.83 million in PPP loans in 2020 and 2021 that were subsequently forgiven.
Smucker is a Lutheran.


== Pennsylvania Senate ==
Smucker was a member of the West Lampeter Township Planning Commission for four years before serving two terms as a township supervisor. In 2008, after 23-year incumbent Gib Armstrong decided to retire, Smucker entered the four-way Republican primary to succeed him, receiving 47% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated the Democratic nominee, Lancaster City Council member Jos√© E. Urdaneta, 57%-43%.

=== Elections ===
On November 8, 2016, Smucker defeated Christina Hartman with 53% of the vote in the race to replace the retiring Joe Pitts in Congress. He was sworn in to represent Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district on January 3, 2017.A new congressional map imposed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court renumbered Smucker's district as the 11th district. It picked up the sliver of Lancaster County that had previously been in the 7th district, while losing its shares of Chester and Berks counties. To make up for the loss in population, it was shifted to the west, absorbing most of the more rural eastern portion of York County. The old 16th had been one of Pennsylvania's most Republican districts, but the Democratic trend in areas of the district closer to Philadelphia had resulted in close races at the presidential level since the turn of the millennium. John McCain only carried the old 16th with 51% of the vote in 2008, while Mitt Romney won it with 52% in 2012 and Donald Trump won it with 51% in 2016. According to Nate Cohn of The New York Times, these trends theoretically left Smucker vulnerable in a Democratic wave.In contrast, the new 11th is significantly more rural and Republican than its predecessor. Had it existed in 2016, Trump would have won it with over 60% of the vote, which would have been his fifth-best showing in the state. According to Cohn, the Republican-controlled state legislature had placed the more Democratic areas of Chester and Berks counties into the 16th in order to protect Republican incumbents in neighboring districts. As Cohn put it, the loss of those areas and the addition of part of York County had the effect of making what was already a "naturally Republican" district even more so.As expected, Smucker won a second term handily, defeating Democratic nominee Jess King with 59% of the vote.
