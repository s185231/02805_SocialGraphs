In January 2014, during President Obama's State of the Union address, Weber in a tweet called Obama "Kommandant-In-Chef" [sic] and "the Socialist dictator." After the White House apologized for failing to send a higher-profile leader to a demonstration in Paris after the January 2015 terrorist attacks in that city, Weber tweeted, "Even Adolph [sic] Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris." Weber then wrote that he needed to "apologize to all those offended by my tweet". He did not delete his tweet made during the State of the Union address.
In 2015, Weber cosponsored a resolution to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Weber also cosponsored a resolution disagreeing with the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.In April 2015, Weber met with Aleksandr Torshin, the alleged handler for Russian spy Maria Butina, according to internal documents from Center for the National Interest.The American Conservative Union gave him a 92% evaluation, Americans for Prosperity gave him a 94% evaluation, Campaign for Working Families, Concerned Women for America, and Faith and Freedom Coalition each gave him 100% evaluations, Conservative Review gave him a 73% evaluation, Eagle Forum gave him an 80% evaluation, National Journal gave him an 89% evaluation, and the John Birch Society gave him a 67% evaluation.
In December 2020, Weber was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion." She also reprimanded Weber and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions."Weber is a supporter of efforts to impeach President Biden. In September 2021, Weber submitted a resolution to impeach Biden "for perpetuating a perception that Afghan security forces were winning the war against the Taliban." That same month, he also co-sponsored a resolution by Bob Gibbs to impeach Biden.
