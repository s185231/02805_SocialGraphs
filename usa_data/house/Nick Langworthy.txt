Erie County Republican Committee Chair James P. Domagalski resigned his chairmanship in 2010 to run for the New York State Senate. An early front-runner for the county chairship, Langworthy made himself as visible as possible on the county and state Republican scenes. Langworthy unanimously won a special election for the chairship, becoming the youngest chair of either political party in Erie County's history. He was the only Republican county chair to endorse Carl Paladino in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2010; he emerged as a political powerhouse when Paladino won the primary.  Paladino's primary upset, together with the Republicans' successful effort to take control of the Erie County legislature, led Buffalo News chief political columnist Bob McCarthy to call Langworthy the "GOP's Young Elder".In 2016, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Langworthy would serve on the executive committee of his transition team. Langworthy had been a vocal supporter of Trump's presidential campaign.In September 2019, it was announced that Langworthy would be succeeded as Erie County chair by Boston, New York Republican chair Karl J. Simmeth Jr.
