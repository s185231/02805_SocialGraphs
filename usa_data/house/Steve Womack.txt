Womack was born in Russellville, Arkansas, the son of Elisabeth F. (Canerday) and James Kermit Womack. Womack's father founded KURM-AM in 1979, a radio station serving the Fayetteville, Arkansas area. He spent most of his childhood in Moberly, Missouri, but moved back to Russellville at age 16 and graduated from Russellville High School in 1975. He graduated with a B.A. in communications from Arkansas Tech University in 1979. Shortly afterward, he enlisted in the Arkansas Army National Guard. He served for 30 years, retiring in 2009 as a colonel. He simultaneously served as station manager for KURM (AM) from 1979 to 1990.
Womack served in a variety of command and staff positions with the Arkansas Army National Guard, including platoon leader, troop commander, battalion commander, and regimental commander.
After the September 11 attacks, Womack's unit, the 2nd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment of Arkansas 39th Infantry Brigade, was called to active duty for service with the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai, Egypt. His task force was trained at Fort Carson, Colorado, and deployed overseas in January 2002. On 13 January 2002, TF 2-153 became the first pure National Guard unit to receive the mission as the United States Battalion (US BATT) in the MFO.

=== Elections ===


==== 2010 ====

In late 2009, Womack jumped into the race for the 3rd District after incumbent Representative John Boozman announced that he would run for the United States Senate. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed that whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next representative. Womack ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote. In the June runoff, he defeated state Senator and fellow Rogers resident Cecile Bledsoe, 52%-48%.In the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.


==== 2012 ====

Womack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his reelection bid, but Aden withdrew from the race on July 8, after admitting to exaggerating his military record. As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November. He was reelected with 76% of the vote, defeating Rebekah Kennedy (Green Party of the United States, 16%) and David Pangrac (Libertarian Party (United States), 8%).


==== 2014 ====

Thomas Brewer, a math teacher and minister, originally announced he was challenging Womack for the Republican nomination, and Troy Gittings, a high school English teacher and stand-up comedian, had announced he was running for the Democratic nomination. But neither Brewer nor Gittings ended up filing, leaving Libertarian Grant Brand as Womack's only challenger. He was reelected with 79% of the vote to Brand's 21%.


==== 2016 ====

Womack again faced no Democratic candidate in the general election. He defeated Libertarian Steve Isaacson 77%-23%.


==== 2018 ====

Womack faced a Republican primary challenge from Robb Ryerse, a self-described "progressive Republican." He defeated Ryerse, 84%-16%.In the general election, Womack faced Democratic opposition for the first time as an incumbent. Womack defeated Josh Mahoney, president of the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund and former chairman of the Fayetteville Airport Commission, and Libertarian Michael Kalagias, on election day, 65%-33%-2%, his smallest margin of victory to date.
