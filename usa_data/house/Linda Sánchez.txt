=== 39th congressional district (2003–2013) ===
Sánchez started her political career in what was then the 39th district. That district had previously been the 38th, represented by five-term Republican Steve Horn. It already had a modest Democratic lean, but redistricting following the 2000 U.S. census made it even more Democratic, prompting Horn to retire.
Sánchez finished first in a six-person primary for the Democratic nomination in March 2002. She won the primaries with 33.5% of the vote; the second-place candidate, Hector de la Torre, received 29.3%. She went on to win the general election against Republican Tim Escobar, 54.9% to 40.8%. This made Sánchez the first woman IBEW member to be elected to Congress.She ran unopposed in the Democratic primaries in 2004. She faced Escobar again in the general election, defeating him 60.7% to 39.3%. In the 2006 election, she defeated two primary challengers with 77.8% of the vote and attorney James L. Andion in the general election.
Linda and her sister Loretta became the first pair of sisters to serve together in the U.S. House of Representatives. Loretta represented an Orange County district from 1997 until 2017, after she announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate. She finished second in California's "top two" primary, before she was defeated by fellow Democrat, then state attorney general, now Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2016 general election.

On October 4, 2011, Sánchez made a statement on LGBT History Month, saying: "We must continue to strive to end discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation and fight so that all Americans have the right to marry and start families with those they love. I remain committed to supporting marriage equality, investments in HIV/AIDS care, treatment and research, and campaigns that take action against bullying in schools."In a February 9, 2010, letter to President Barack Obama, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Charles Schumer, Sánchez wrote: "Currently, U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents may sponsor their spouses (and other immediate family members) for immigration purposes. But same-sex partners committed to spending their lives together are not recognized as 'families' under U.S. immigration law and thus do not have this same right. [...] This is unacceptable, and we believe comprehensive immigration reform legislation must include a strong family reunification component inclusive of LGBT families."

After the Arizona state legislature passed State Senate Bill 1070 and Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed it into law, Sánchez claimed that the law, and similar laws throughout the country, were the product of white supremacists: "There's a concerted effort behind promoting these kinds of laws on a state-by-state basis by people who have ties to white supremacy groups. It's been documented. It's not mainstream politics." Representative Gary Miller called Sánchez's comments "an outrageous accusation." Steve Poizner also condemned them.


=== Technology ===
Twice in 2009, Sánchez introduced the "Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act," H.R. 1966, a bill that would criminalize the use of electronic communications if "the intent is to coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress to a person." The bill is a response to the suicide of Megan Meier, a 13-year-old girl whose 2006 suicide was attributed to cyberbullying on the social networking site MySpace.

Linda Sánchez, Loretta Sánchez and Richard Buskin, Dream in Color: How the Sánchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress, Grand Central Publishing (September 2, 2008) ISBN 978-0-446-50804-9, foreword by Nancy PelosiIn 2008, Loretta and Linda Sánchez published the joint memoir Dream in Color: How the Sánchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress. Publishers Weekly reviewed the book and wrote: "Linda and Loretta Sánchez present their compelling story—noteworthy not only for their history-making achievements (including first sisters or women of any relation to serve together in Congress, first woman and person of color to represent a district in Orange County, first Latina on the House Judiciary Committee and first Head Start child to be elected to Congress) but also for its 'American Dream' aspect—their parents immigrated from Mexico and despite lacking a formal education managed to send their seven children to college. Interweaving childhood vignettes with accounts of serving in Congress, both from California, this refreshing book evades many of the tropes of the typical political memoir—perhaps because these two women are not typical politicians."
