The seat had long been a majority-black district, but redistricting after the 2010 census made it a 55% Hispanic-majority district.In the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—Rangel beat Espaillat, 44% to 42%, a margin of less than 1,000 votes. Espaillat placed first in the Bronx section of the district and parts of Upper Manhattan.The election was marked by reports that Spanish-speaking voters were either turned away at the polls or forced to use affidavit ballots.
