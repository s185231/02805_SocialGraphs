Michael Bruce Quigley ( KWIG-lee; born October 17, 1958) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Illinois's 5th congressional district since the April 7, 2009 special election. The district includes most of Chicago's North Side and several of its western suburbs. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Quigley is a former member of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, where he represented Chicago's northside neighborhoods of Lakeview, Uptown, and Rogers Park. He previously taught environmental policy and Chicago politics as an adjunct professor at Loyola University Chicago.Chicago Sun-Times political writer Fran Spielman has described Quigley as, "a political centrist with a progressive bent".


== Early life, education, and early political career ==
Quigley was raised in Carol Stream, Illinois, where he graduated from Glenbard North High School in 1977. He then attended Roosevelt University, where he earned his bachelor's degree. Quigley moved into the Lakeview area of Chicago in 1982, and became involved in community activities. He attended the Loyola University Chicago School of Law, where he earned a Juris Doctor degree, and the University of Chicago, where he earned a master's degree in public policy.
The start of Quigley's political career saw him serve as a chief aide to Chicago Alderman Bernie Hansen.


== Cook County Board of Commissioners ==
Quigley was first elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 1998, succeeding Maria Pappas, who was elected Cook County Treasurer. During his tenure, he gained a reputation as a reformer, opposing tax hikes that were supported by Cook County Board President John Stroger and later his son and successor Todd Stroger. Quigley contended the county could operate more efficiently and presented reports to support his position. He also challenged the practice of finding jobs for Democratic officials with the Cook County Forest Preserve District.

=== Elections ===


==== 2009 ====

In early 2009, incumbent U.S. Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois's 5th congressional district resigned to become White House Chief of Staff to newly elected President Barack Obama. The congressional vacancy was filled via the special election. Quigley was one of 12 candidates to file in the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district. He was endorsed by the Chicago Sun-Times, which called him "a constant advocate for fiscal responsibility and a watchdog against waste and corruption". He was also endorsed by the Chicago Tribune, which cited Quigley's efforts to improve county government, noting, "If Quigley's ideas had all been put in place, the county would not be crying now for more money". He won the March special primary with 22% of the vote. The second-place candidate, State Representative John Fritchey, received 18%. After the primary, Quigley won the April special election with 69% of the vote over Republican challenger Rosanna Pulido. The district and its predecessors have been in Democratic hands for all but three years since 1909.


==== 2010 ====

Quigley won reelection to his first full term in 2010 with 71% of the vote.


==== 2012 ====

After redistricting, Quigley's district was pushed into DuPage County. The new district absorbed the home of 13th district Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert. But Biggert opted to run in the 11th district, the successor to the old 13th. The old 5th is only slightly less Democratic than its predecessor; Obama won the district in 2008 with 70% (down three points from the old 5th), and 2010 Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Alexi Giannoulias carried it with 55% of the vote. No Democrat filed to run against him. Only one Republican filed, self-employed businessman Dan Schmitt.


=== Tenure ===
On July 12, 2017, Quigley introduced H. R. 2884, "The Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement Act (COVFEFE Act)". The bill would require the National Archives to preserve and store social media posts by the President of the United States. It was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on the same day, yet saw no further congressional action.On September 30, 2023, Quigley was the sole Democrat to vote against Republican-introduced legislation to keep the U.S. government funded, citing its lack of aid to Ukraine.


==== Gun control ====
In May 2011, Quigley sponsored an amendment to the Patriot Act prohibiting the sale of weapons to people on the FBI's Terrorist Watch List. He believed that the Republican limitation of civil liberties under the Patriot Act contradicted their unwillingness to limit Second Amendment rights. This bill, proposed as an amendment to the Patriot Act, came under fire from Representatives James Sensenbrenner Jr. and Louie Gohmert, who argued that it would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of those mistakenly placed on the Terrorist Watch List. The bill failed on a party-line House Judiciary panel vote, 21–11.


==== Public health ====
Quigley has received a rating of 100 (on a scale of 1 to 100) from the American Public Health Association, indicating his strong support of healthcare legislation. In April 2011, he voted against Paul Ryan's budget plan (which involved budget cuts to Medicare, as well as decreased government funding to help citizens procure health insurance). Also in April 2011, Quigley voted against repealing the "Prevention and Public Health" fund, a fund focused on Community and Clinical Prevention of chronic diseases, as well as allotting money towards health-care infrastructure and research. He also voted for increases in government spending on physical and occupational therapy.
In March 2021, Quigley announced his support for the Medicare for All Act of 2021 introduced by Pramila Jayapal and Debbie Dingell.


==== Environment ====
A Sierra Club member since high school, Quigley initially joined politics because of his desire to help the environment through legislation. He has enacted this desire through supporting the American Clean Energy and Security Act, a 2009 bill to create an emissions trading plan which passed in the House of Representatives, but was defeated in the Senate. Quigley also introduced the Federal Birdsafe Buildings Bill, a 2011 initiative to make all buildings built by the General Services Administration built with the maximum amount of bird-safe materials and features. In April 2011, he voted to prohibit invasive research on great apes.


==== Veterans ====
Quigley has worked to improve healthcare and education opportunities for veterans. His district office is also known to make services available to veterans whenever they need it, such as helping one veteran receive medals that he had been waiting over 20 years to receive. In 2013, Quigley introduced a bill to the House to prevent veterans from entering into debt to pay for tuition before GI benefits are received. His hope was to provide greater educational opportunities to veterans with this bill.


==== Abortion ====
Quigley supports reproductive rights, and voted against banning federal health coverage for abortions. He also supports federal funding for family planning and sex education, as well as creating more preventive steps to avoid unwanted pregnancies altogether.


==== LGBTQ rights ====
Quigley supports LGBTQ rights, and showed his support in 2012 by participating in National Coming Out Day as a show of solidarity. He has called for the FDA to revoke its ban on allowing blood donations from gay and bisexual men.In September 2014, Quigley was one of 69 members of Congress to sign a letter to then-FDA commissioner Sylvia Burwell requesting that the FDA revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding five years.
