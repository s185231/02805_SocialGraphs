=== Political positions ===


==== National security ====
Arrington supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order curtailing Middle Eastern immigration, saying: "It is important that our commander in chief puts the safety of Americans first. Given concerns about the inadequate vetting of refugees and problems with our immigration system, this temporary pause is intended to ensure the safety of our citizens."


==== Unemployment benefits ====
In defending a proposal to cut access to the SNAP program (food stamps), Arrington cited the biblical passage Thessalonians 3:10, saying: "He says even when we were with you we give you this rule, 'If a man will not work he shall not eat.' And he goes on to say, 'We heard that some of you are idle.' I think that every American, Republican or Democrat wants to help the needy among us. And I think it's a reasonable expectation that we have work requirements. I think that gives more credibility, frankly, to SNAP."


==== Texas v. Pennsylvania ====
In December 2020, Arrington was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

==== Israel ====
Arrington voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.


==== 2020 election certification ====
Arrington opposed certifying the electoral vote count in the 2020 presidential election, citing "millions of American voters" who felt that the election "was not conducted in an equitable or accurate manner." He later condemned the attack on the United States Capitol that occurred on January 6, 2021. In the weeks that followed, Arrington voted against the second impeachment of President Trump.
