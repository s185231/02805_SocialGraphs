=== Tenure ===
Garbarino was sworn in on January 3, 2021.
On January 6, 2021, Garbarino did not object to the Electoral College results, saying:The role of Congress is not to overturn the election or to take actions that silence voters. The Constitution is clear, the votes must be counted and certified by the states and Congress has the constitutional obligation to accept those electors and certify each states’ elections. All 50 states have certified their elections and the majority of electors have cast their votes for President-Elect Joe Biden. While I join many Long Islanders in wishing the results were different, Congress does not have the constitutional authority to overturn the election.In March 2021, Garbarino was one of eight House Republicans to vote for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021.Garbarino voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, as did every congressional Republican.On May 19, 2021, Garbarino was one of 35 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting to approve legislation to establish the January 6, 2021 commission meant to investigate the storming of the U.S. Capitol.

In 2021, Garbarino co-sponsored the Fairness for All Act, the Republican alternative to the Equality Act. The bill would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, and protect the free exercise of religion.
