=== Abortion ===
Luna has said she favors abortion bans, and has called herself a "pro-life extremist". She has said her anti-abortion stance originates from having dissected a chicken egg in college and seeing the chick react to a scalpel blade: "God was using that opportunity to really wake me up."


=== Economy ===
In an August 2022 interview, Luna said that she would support a ban on U.S. oil exports to increase the domestic oil supply, saying, "The United States has literally one of the biggest supplies of cleanest oil in the entire world. There's no reason why we need to be going to places like Saudi Arabia or even Venezuela to get those oil sources." She said this view belonged to an "America First" platform, adding, "If it means not selling to other countries so that here in the United States, we can literally lower the gas prices, that's what I agree with."Luna has said tourism is one of her highest priorities due to its importance in her district.Luna was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

The FEC complaint said that Twitter violated the equal time rule by verifying Charlie Crist but not Luna and asked the FEC to force Twitter to verify Luna's account.During a combative House of Representatives Oversight Committtee hearing on February 8, 2023, Luna alleged that Twitter, the federal government, "leftist nonprofits", and potentially the Democratic National Committee had acted jointly to censor Americans in November 2020 through the Jira project management platform, and that it violated the First Amendment.

== Disputed biographical claims ==


=== Religious and ethnic background ===
Luna has claimed her father raised her to follow Messianic Judaism, an evangelical movement that incorporates Jewish traditions into Protestant Christianity, and that she is "a small fraction Ashkenazi". Members of her extended family have said her father was Catholic and that "they were not aware of him practicing any form of Judaism while Luna was growing up". Her mother has said that Luna's father was a "Christian that embraced the Messianic faith" after getting clean from drug addiction. Her grandfather, Heinrich Mayerhofer, identified as Catholic when he immigrated to Canada in 1954.In 2020, Luna claimed in a PragerU documentary that her "entire mother's side of the family and father's side of the family on both sides are from Mexico". Her paternal grandfather, however, was German.


=== Difficult childhood ===
Luna has said that she "grew up in the welfare system" and was raised by her mother on government assistance with "no family to rely on". Her father was a drug addict, and she has said that at the age of 10 she found his bag of meth and was raised in a "broken home mentality". She has said that her grandmother died of AIDS due to heroin use. Luna has claimed that she and her mother lacked "a strong extended network of people" who could help care for them, and that she had attended "over six high schools" before graduating.Luna's cousin has said, "The whole family kind of raised her—my dad was a part of her life when she was younger and we all kind of coddled her ... She was always a part of everything, all these family gatherings and activities". Luna's aunt said, "She had everything. What she needed and more ... And not only did [Luna's mother] provide for her, but [Luna's grandfather] did, too".Luna has disputed these accounts, saying she "barely spent any time with them in her entire life". Luna's mother said she had to rely on welfare for periods of time, especially while she was putting herself through college at the University of California, Irvine and then at the UCLA School of Law, and that she was the only source of meaningful financial support for the family.Air Force members who served with Luna in Missouri said she wore designer clothing and that she had mentioned having nannies as a child. Luna's mother said she owned a designer coat she bought at a thrift store and was known to wear it frequently, and that the idea of her having had nannies is "preposterous".


=== Father's incarceration ===
Luna's campaign website biography says that throughout her childhood and teenage years, her father "spent time in and out of incarceration", and that she communicated with him "through letters to jail and collect calls". Luna's mother and aunt said that he served several short stints in jail for not paying child support. Luna's mother also said that he spent at least one year in jail for a drug-related charge.A dismissed misdemeanor drug possession case indicated that Luna's father was in custody around the time of two court appearances, but the case information did not specify the length of his confinement, and court proceedings lasted only about three months.


=== Home break-in ===
In 2019, Luna said that she suffered "enduring trauma" after experiencing a "home invasion" by her landlord at 4 a.m. while stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base. "Had my friend Jeremy not been there to protect me, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be standing right here in front of you guys right now."Luna's roommate said she did not remember such an incident. Instead, the roommate recalled a daytime break-in when Luna was not home. A Warrensburg Police Department report described the July 2010 incident as a "burglary not in progress". The report states that Luna and her roommate had reported to their landlord that the home's rear door had repeatedly been left open, so the landlord installed new locks, deadbolts and latches, but the problem persisted. Police records indicate that no suspect was arrested or charged in the case.


=== Conflict with uncle ===
During her first campaign for Congress in 2020, Luna sought a stalking injunction request against her uncle, Edward Mayerhofer, after he questioned her biography on social media.

Luna is married to Andrew Gamberzky, a U.S. Air Force combat controller. After marriage, she changed her surname to Gamberzky. In 2019, she took her grandmother's maiden name, Luna, to represent her Hispanic heritage. She did this after her mother changed her name to Luna after a divorce. Luna began describing herself as Hispanic in 2019; when she registered to vote in 2015, she marked her ethnicity as "White, not of Hispanic origin."Luna announced that she gave birth to a son on August 27, 2023.
