LaMalfa worked with Bernie Richter as an early supporter of Proposition 209, which ended affirmative action in California.

In June 2008, he urged voters to approve Proposition 8, saying "This is an opportunity to take back a little bit of dignity ... for kids, for all of us in California. It really disturbs me that the will of the people was overridden by four members of the Supreme Court."LaMalfa opposed Mike Feuer's microstamping bill, AB 1471, which Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law on October 13, 2007.LaMalfa was a co-author of ACA 20, which would empower law enforcement to act as Immigration, Customs Enforcement Agents and would have cracked down on illegal immigration.In 2007, LaMalfa successfully passed AB 1645, a law that would prevent seizures of firearms in the event of an emergency or natural disaster.

He said that Governor Jerry Brown was "out of touch with what I think are still mainstream American values. That's not the kind of stuff I want my kids learning about in public school. They've really crossed a line into a new frontier."LaMalfa strongly opposed the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which would bypass the Electoral College, saying, "I think this is dangerous.

=== Climate change ===
LaMalfa has said, "The climate of the globe has been fluctuating since God created it", and that the Book of Genesis disproves the scientific consensus on climate change, which he has called "bad science". In 2017, he said, "I don't buy the idea that manmade activity is responsible." In 2018, amid wildfires, LaMalfa said, "I'm not going to quibble here today about whether it's man, or sunspot activity, or magma causing ice shelves to melt." He suggested the wildfires were due to poor land management by state and federal agencies.


=== Donald Trump ===
During President Donald Trump's first impeachment, LaMalfa voted against impeachment, believing that Trump did not do anything that warranted impeachment, including during his phone call with the President of Ukraine.After Trump lost the 2020 election and refused to concede, LaMalfa claimed that "the circumstances surrounding this presidential election point to a fraudulent outcome." In December 2020, LaMalfa was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives who signed an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion."On January 7, 2021, following the storming of the U.S. Capitol building by Trump supporters, LaMalfa and six other California representatives voted to reject the certification of Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election.

He also claimed it is not Congress's job to deal with racism in the government.In June 2021, LaMalfa was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against legislation to establish Juneteenth, a celebration of the end of slavery, as a federal holiday.

=== Farming ===
From 1995 to 2016, LaMalfa's own farm received the largest amount of public assistance money from agricultural subsidies (over $1.7 million) in the history of Congress. As a member of the House Agricultural Committee, LaMalfa oversees farm subsidies, presenting a conflict of interest. In 2017, his spokesman, Parker Williams, said that LaMalfa "voted to end direct farm subsidy payments in the very first farm bill he worked on" and that a new farm bill proposed does not provide subsidies for rice grown in California, a crop that LaMalfa farms. He supported the 2020–2021 Indian farmers' protest.


=== LGBT rights ===
LaMalfa opposes same-sex marriage and has said that legalizing it would "open the floodgates" for polygamy to be legalized. He has said that marriage is "an institution created by God and supposed to be held up and respected by men and women." He endorsed the First Amendment Defense Act, which, among other things, sought to criminalize same-sex intercourse. In 2015, LaMalfa consponsored a resolution to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. On July 19, 2022, he voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would protect the right to same-sex marriage at a federal level.


=== Voter fraud ===
LaMalfa has said, "California is just a sieve on its voter security." Speaking about his own district, he said, "There's a percentage of illegal votes, probably in every district. Is it high here? Probably not. We don't really have the demographics that would be a really big push of that."


=== Taxes ===
LaMalfa voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. According to him, the bill will enable his constituents to save more money and give them tax relief. He said that the bill will give a "booster shot to the U.S. economy", enable businesses to hire more workers, and cause more products to be made in the USA, especially in Redding.


=== Colleagues ===
