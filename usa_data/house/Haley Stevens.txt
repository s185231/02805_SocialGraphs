=== Elections ===


==== 2018 ====

Over January and February 2017, Stevens moved back to Rochester Hills. She announced her candidacy for the United States House of Representatives seat in Michigan's 11th congressional district in April 2017. The district had been represented by two-term Republican Dave Trott.Trott announced his retirement in September 2017, making the 11th an open seat. Stevens defeated state Representative Tim Greimel in the Democratic Party primary election and Republican businesswoman Lena Epstein in the general election. Her victory, and that of Elissa Slotkin in the neighboring 8th district, made it the first time since the 1930s that no Republicans represented Oakland County in the House. She also became the first Democrat to represent the 11th for a full term since it assumed its current configuration in 2003.
Stevens and Colin Allred, both alumni of the Obama administration, were selected as co-presidents of the House Democratic Freshman Class of the 116th United States Congress.


==== 2020 ====

Stevens ran for reelection. She was unopposed in the Democratic primary.  In the general election, she defeated the Republican nominee, Eric Esshaki, by less than expected.


==== 2022 ====

Stevens defeated Andy Levin, 60%-40%, becoming the first woman to represent the 11th District. As a result of population loss, Michigan lost a seat in the United States House of Representatives.  The newly drawn 11th District put Stevens and fellow Congressman Andy Levin in the same district.  The redrawing of the district covered more of Stevens's earlier electoral base.  She reportedly outspent Levin by a factor of five. Her victory was aided by $5 million from EMILY's list and by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which invested $4 million targeting Levin and hailed her victory as proof that "being pro-Israel is both good policy and good politics". Changes in generational and gender dynamics are also said to have played an important role, with a long term Oakland Democrat trend to favor women, and the impact of the Supreme Court's overturning the Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey precedents regarding abortion.
