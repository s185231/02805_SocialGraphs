After serving 18 years, Republican incumbent Peter Hoekstra retired to run for the Republican nomination for governor. Huizenga defeated Jay Riemersma, State Senator Wayne Kuipers, businessman Bill Cooper, and three others in the Republican primary election—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—on August 3, 2010. Huizenga defeated Democratic nominee Fred Johnson, 64% to 32%. The district was rated "Solid Republican" by The New York Times. The district and its predecessors have been in Republican hands for all but four years since 1873, and without interruption since 1935.

For his first six terms, Huizenga represented much of Lake Michigan's eastern shore and many of Grand Rapids's suburbs, including Muskegon, Holland, Kentwood, and Grand Haven. However, redistricting after the 2020 census saw the district significantly redrawn. It was renumbered as the 4th district and pushed well to the south. It picked up Kalamazoo and Battle Creek while losing Muskegon, all of its share of Kent County and much of its share of Ottawa County. In the process, the district lost its connection to longtime Congressman Guy Vander Jagt, who represented the district (then numbered as the 9th) from 1967 to 1993. 
The reconfigured district included much of the territory of the Kalamazoo-based 6th district, represented by 18-term incumbent and fellow Republican Fred Upton. Upton opted to retire, effectively handing the Republican nomination to Huizenga. The new 4th was no less Republican than the old 2nd, and Huizenga easily won a seventh term.


=== Tenure ===
In December 2020, Huizenga was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that called signing the amicus brief an act of "election subversion." She also reprimanded Huizenga and the other House members who supported the lawsuit: "The 126 Republican Members that signed onto this lawsuit brought dishonor to the House. Instead of upholding their oath to support and defend the Constitution, they chose to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions."As of January 2022, Huizenga has voted with President Biden's stated position roughly 14% of the time.
