=== LGBT library book incident ===
On June 17, 2021, Van Orden confronted a teenaged library page at Prairie du Chien Memorial Library in indignation over a display of books with LGBT themes assembled for Pride Month. Van Orden was particularly upset by the book A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo, about a fictional day in the life of Marlon Bundo, the real-life pet rabbit of former Vice President of the United States Mike Pence, and the rabbit's subsequent same-sex romance. Van Orden submitted a written complaint to the library that the book was "skewing young people to think that Republicans are not inclusive. This book is not informational, it is propaganda". A staff member described Van Orden as "very uncomfortable, threatening" with "full-on shouting" and "aggressively shoving the books around". He wanted to know who had established the display so he could "teach them a lesson". Van Orden subsequently withdrew all the books on display out of the library and then returned them within a week.

He was placed on one year's probation on December 28, 2021.


=== Yelling at Senate pages ===
According to Punchbowl News, Van Orden was giving a tour for several dozen visitors around midnight on the evening of July 26, 2023, when he happened upon Senate pages (who are all 16 or 17 years old), lying on the floor of the rotunda, taking photos of the interior of the Capitol dome; NBC News later reported that this is a traditional activity for the pages to commemorate their last week of service. Punchbowl News also reported that the pages are directed to sit in the rotunda awaiting instructions while the Senate is in late-night session, as it was that night. Van Orden "cursed out the pages...calling them 'lazy shits' and told them to 'get the fuck up' off the floor" and reportedly screamed at them "inches from the pages' faces," and then said, "I don’t give a f---who you are. I’m a congressman."It was later reported that Van Orden had been partying loudly at an event in his office where alcohol was being served, prior to yelling at the pages, and several news outlets reported that he had bottles of alcohol on desks and in trash cans in his office earlier that evening as part of a party with 50 constituents. His communications director, Anna Kelly, told The Washington Post that Van Orden "regularly hosts beer and cheese tours with constituents."Van Orden's behavior was condemned by his fellow Republicans, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Thom Tillis, who said, "This is inexcusable and embarrassing behavior for a member of Congress or any adult for that matter. The Congressman should do the right thing and apologize." Republican Representative Chip Roy later took a photo of himself on the floor of the Senate Rotunda in support of the pages.
