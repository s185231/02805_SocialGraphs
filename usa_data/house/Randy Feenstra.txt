=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

In 2019, Feenstra announced he would challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Representative Steve King in the 2020 Republican primary in Iowa's 4th congressional district. His state senate district includes much of the northwestern portion of the congressional district. King, a nine-term incumbent, has a record of making inflammatory remarks, including support of the term "white nationalist." He had been stripped of his committee seats for asking why "white nationalist" was offensive. Feenstra noted this in announcing his campaign, saying that King's "caustic nature" had left the 4th "without a seat at the table."Republican Party leadership supported Feenstra in the primary. Feenstra raised more money during the primary than King, and was supported by the United States Chamber of Commerce and National Right to Life Committee. Feenstra's candidacy was also supported by conservative political commentator and radio host Ben Shapiro, who donated and urged his Twitter followers to donate to Feenstra's campaign.Feenstra won the June 2 primary with 45.7% of the vote to King's 36%. Much of Feenstra's margin came from dominating his state senate district, which he carried with almost 75% of the vote. He defeated J. D. Scholten in the general election by a large margin, winning every county in his district except Story County.
