== Florida House of Representatives ==
When State Representative Ron Reagan was unable to seek reelection in 2010 due to term limits, Steube ran to succeed him in the 67th District, based in southern Hillsborough County, eastern Manatee County, and northern Sarasota County, stretching from Apollo Beach to Fruitville. He received an endorsement from U.S. Representative Vern Buchanan, who called Steube "extremely knowledgeable of the district and the district's issues." In the Republican primary, he defeated Jeremiah J. Guccione and Robert McCann with 53% of the vote to Guccione's 28% and McCann's 19%. He advanced to the general election, where he faced Democratic nominee Z. J. Hafeez and independent candidate John M. Studebaker. Both candidates opposed  offshore oil drilling off the coast of the state, supported solar energy, and favored medical tort law reform "that they [felt would] increase access to health care for Floridians." Steube won 68% of the vote to Hafeez's 27% and Studebaker's 5%.After the reconfiguration of state legislative districts in 2012, Steube's district was renumbered the 73rd district. The district was pushed further into Sarasota County while losing its share of Hillsborough County. Steube won his party's nomination unopposed, and moved on to the general election, facing only Bob McCann, who had previously run against Steube in the 2010 Republican primary, but was running as an independent. Steube and McCann disagreed over whether the state should expand Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, with Steube opposed and McCann in favor, and over whether the state should fund charter schools, with Steube in favor and McCann opposed. Steube was endorsed by the Bradenton Herald, which praised him for his "strong first term and his qualifications", specifically calling him out for working to put two constitutional amendments on the ballot that provide tax exemptions to the spouses of deceased military veterans and property tax relief to low-income seniors. Steube defeated McCann with 74% of the vote. In 2014, Steube was reelected to his third term in the legislature without opposition.

=== Elections ===


==== 2018 ====

Steube ran for the Republican nomination for Florida's 17th Congressional District in 2018, a seat that was being vacated by Tom Rooney, who declined to seek reelection.

==== 2020 ====

Steube was reelected in 2020 with 64.6% of the vote, defeating Democrat Allen Ellison.


==== 2022 ====
For his first two terms, Steube represented a large swath of south-central Florida, from the outer suburbs of Sarasota and Fort Myers through the Everglades to the shores of Lake Okeechobee. However, after the 2020 census, his district was made significantly more compact, picking up all of Sarasota while losing most of its inland territory to the 18th district. The new 19th was no less Republican than its predecessor, and Steube easily won a third term.

Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump.
