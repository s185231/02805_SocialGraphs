=== Elections ===


==== 2020 ====

Clyde announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 9th congressional district after five-term incumbent Doug Collins decided not to seek reelection to run for the United States Senate. During the campaign, he sued the city of Athens, Georgia, over a shelter-in-place order imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic that he said compelled his business to close.Clyde finished second in the nine-way Republican primary behind State Representative Matt Gurtler in a runoff election. The 9th is one of the most Republican districts in the nation, and it was understood whoever won the runoff would be heavily favored to be the district's next congressman. Clyde won the August 11 runoff.Clyde defeated Democratic nominee and former U.S. Army warrant officer Devin Pandy in the November general election, and assumed office on January 3, 2021.


=== Tenure ===
On January 6, 2021, during the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count, Clyde was one of 120 Republican representatives who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election results in both Arizona and Pennsylvania. On March 17, 2021, he also was one of 12 House Republicans to vote against HR 1085 to award three Congressional Gold Medals to the United States police who protected the U.S. Capitol during the 2021 United States Capitol attack. In June 2021, Clyde and 20 other House Republicans voted against a similar resolution.In May 2021, during a House Oversight Committee hearing, Clyde said that the Capitol attack was "no insurrection" and that there was video of the event that resembled a "normal tourist visit", with Trump supporters behaving "in an orderly fashion, staying between the stanchions and ropes taking videos and pictures". During that same hearing, Clyde acknowledged that during the attack, he "helped barricade the [House chamber] door until almost 3 p.m. from the mob who tried to enter". Fellow lawmakers Adam Kinzinger and Eric Swalwell criticized him for later refusing to shake the hand of a police officer who had been beaten unconscious during the attack.In June 2021, Clyde was among 14 House Republicans who voted against legislation to establish June 19, or Juneteenth, as a federal holiday. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Clyde "supported the holiday but didn't like its title, Juneteenth National Independence Day".On February 28, 2022, Clyde was one of three representatives to vote against the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which made lynching a federal hate crime.In April 2022, he led a Republican effort to block the naming of a federal building in Florida after Joseph W. Hatchett, the first Black State Supreme Court judge in Florida and south of the Masonâ€“Dixon line. Clyde justified the action, saying that Hatchett had ruled to block prayer at public schools. Naming of federal buildings is usually among the more mundane uncontroversial tasks of Congress, and it is usually accomplished without debate or a recorded vote.On November 3, 2022, Clyde introduced the Expose Biden's Inflation, Deficits, and Economic Neglect (BIDEN) Act.In February 2023, Clyde co-sponsored a bill to designate the "AR-15-style rifle" the National Gun of the United States.Clyde was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.Clyde voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.
