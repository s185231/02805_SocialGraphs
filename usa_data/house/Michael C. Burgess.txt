=== Elections ===
Burgess, who had never held any public office and voted in the Democratic primaries in 1990, 1992, and 1994, entered the 2002 Republican primary election to replace House Majority Leader Dick Armey. His opponent was Armey's son, Scott. The district, comprising almost all of Denton County (except a sliver in the southeast), was strongly Republican, and pundits predicted that whoever won the primary would not only win the general election, but be assured of at least a decade in Congress. Using the campaign slogan "My dad is NOT Dick Armey", Burgess touted the support of medical Political Action Committees and organizations like the National Beer Wholesalers Association. Burgess took second place in the primary, with 23% of the vote to Armey's 45%. Since neither candidate earned the required majority of votes, a runoff election ensued. Before the runoff, The Dallas Morning News released a series of articles alleging that Armey used his influence as a judge to procure county jobs and contracts for his friends. The report hurt Armey's campaign, and Burgess won the runoff with 55% of the vote. He won the general election with 75% of the vote.Burgess's vote shares include:

66% in 2004
60% in 2006
60% in 2008
67% in 2010

With 185,268 votes (59.4%), he defeated Democratic nominee Linsey Fagan, who polled 121,584 (39%).

==== Impeachment of Obama ====
On August 9, 2011, Burgess met with a Tea Party group in Keller, Texas, to discuss his vote to raise the debt ceiling. When a constituent asked whether the House was considering impeaching President Barack Obama, Burgess responded, "It needs to happen, and I agree with you it would tie things up ... No question about that."


==== Abortion ====
In 2013, Burgess voted for legislation to ban abortion after the 22nd week of pregnancy.Burgess testified that abortion should be banned after 20 weeks of gestation in part because he believes fetuses can feel pain and pleasure.

Burgess opposed the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In 2010, he voted against the DREAM Act.Burgess supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying that Trump was "well within his authority" to issue the order and that "Congress should remain involved in the process and provide legislation to strengthen not only border security but vetting those who wish to enter the country through any means."Burgess sponsored H.R. 6202, the American Tech Workforce Act of 2021, introduced by Representative Jim Banks. The legislation would establish a wage floor for the high-skill H-1B visa program, thereby significantly reducing employer dependence on the program. The bill would also eliminate the Optional Practical Training program that allows foreign graduates to stay and work in the United States.


==== Health care ====
Burgess is one of nine medical doctors in Congress, and one of seven in the House of Representatives. In May 2009, Congressional Quarterly wrote that Burgess had "become a prominent voice on health care issues" in the House. Since the 111th United States Congress, he has chaired the Congressional Health Care caucus, of which he is the only official member.Burgess supports the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as the ACA or Obamacare. At the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference, he said he favored covering fewer Americans with health insurance. Burgess said, "If the numbers drop, I would say that's a good thing, because we've restored personal liberty in this country."


==== Energy and the environment ====
As a member of the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power, Burgess has been active in the debate over energy policy. In 2011, he submitted an amendment to the 2012 Energy and Water Appropriations Act to defund part of the act that established higher efficiency standards for household light bulbs. Burgess's claims that the standards represented a "ban" on conventional light bulbs were rated as "Mostly False" by the fact-checking website PolitiFact.com. On April 30, 2015, Burgess again introduced an amendment to the $35.4 billion fiscal 2016 energy and water spending bill that would defund the Department of Energy enforcement of incandescent light bulb efficiency standards, which passed 232–189, largely on party lines.Burgess denies the scientific consensus on climate change. In a March 8, 2011, hearing before the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the efforts of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases, Burgess said "My opinion, for what it is worth, is that the science behind global temperature changes is not settled."


==== Lowering the voting age ====
In March 2019, Burgess was the lone Republican to vote to lower the voting age to 16.


==== Texas v. Pennsylvania ====
In December 2020, Burgess was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.
