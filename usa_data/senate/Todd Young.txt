=== Sponsored legislation ===
Fairness for American Families Act (H.R. 2668) – Introduced by Young on July 11, 2013, this bill would "amend the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to delay until 2015 the requirement that individuals maintain minimal essential health care coverage." The bill was proposed in response to a July 2, 2013, decision by the Obama Administration to delay the employer mandate found in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but do nothing to the individual mandate requirement.When he introduced the Fairness for American Families Act, Young argued that "rather than driving healthcare costs down, the individual mandate is imposing a new tax and burdensome costs on middle class families" and therefore "hardworking Americans deserve the same exemptions that President Obama is unilaterally granting to businesses and labor unions."
Save American Workers Act of 2013 – a bill to amend the way in which the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (popularly known as Obamacare) defines full-time worker by raising the 30-hour threshold to 40 hours a week, in an effort to remove the incentive some companies may have to reduce their employees' hours to avoid the employer healthcare mandate. Young introduced it into the House on June 28, 2013.

=== Elections ===


==== 2016 ====

Rather than run for reelection to the House, Young announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2016 election to fill the Senate seat of the retiring Dan Coats. Also filing for the Republican primary was U.S. Representative Marlin Stutzman. Although Young was certified as having submitted enough signatures to qualify for the primary ballot, that official certification was challenged, and a tally by the Associated Press concluded that Young had fallen short. The state Election Commission scheduled a hearing on the challenge for February 19, 2016. The commission voted down the challenge with a 2–2 vote and Young remained on the ballot.Young easily defeated Stutzman in the May 3 primary, taking 67% of approximately one million votes cast. He was initially slated to face former U.S. Representative Baron Hill, whom Young had defeated in 2010 to win his congressional seat, but on July 11, Hill announced he was dropping out of the Senate race. Hill was replaced by Evan Bayh, who had held the seat from 1999 to 2011. Young defeated Bayh in the November 8 general election, winning 52% of the vote to Bayh's 42%.

Young won re-election to a second term in 2022, defeating Democratic nominee Thomas McDermott Jr. 58.6% to 37.9%.


=== Tenure ===
On January 3, 2017, Young was sworn into the United States Senate in the 115th Congress by Vice President Joe Biden. Young was ranked the ninth most bipartisan Senator in the first session of the 115th Congress by the Bipartisan Index, a metric created by the Lugar Center and Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy to assess congressional bipartisanship. GovTrack noted that during the same period, Young joined more bipartisan bills than any other freshman Senator.Young planned to vote in support of certifying the Electoral College count on January 6, 2021. Young also said he supported efforts to create a bipartisan "Election Integrity Committee" to review the 2020 presidential election. While entering the US Capitol to participate in the certification on January 6, 2021, Young was accosted by pro-Trump protestors. He was questioned as to why he would vote to support the count, claiming voter fraud. Young explained that "When it comes to the law, our opinions don't matter — the law matters." The South Bend Tribune's editorial board wrote "Young was right to reject the move that Braun had embraced — but his words should have come two months earlier, not at the last minute. That would have been upholding his duty and fulfilling his oath of office." Young, however, publicly acknowledged Biden as President-elect immediately following the official Electoral College tally on December 15, 2020. He was participating in the count when the storming of the Capitol happened. Upon the storming, Young tweeted "This is not a peaceful protest – it is violence and reprehensible. It must stop." Young then voted in support of certifying the count when Congress was able to return to session. In the wake of the attack, Young would not comment on if he supported using the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remove Trump, stating that he trusted the Vice President and Trump cabinet members to "conscientiously and legally carry out their duties until Jan. 20."In 2022, Young cosponsored, with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY), the CHIPS and Science Act, a $280 billion bill intended to promote basic and advanced technology research and development, with a focus on the American semiconductor industry, aiming to outcompete China in technological fields in the coming years. Young had also been involved in stalled efforts along similar lines on a bill known as United States Innovation and Competition Act in 2021. The CHIPS and Science Act passed the Senate on July 27, 2022, and was signed into law by Joe Biden on August 9, 2022.Since the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, Young has occupied the Senate Candy Desk, replacing retired Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA).
